"Just need to vent. We've been planning our wedding for a year and a half and announced before we even picked a venue that it would be child free (so everyone has had a year+ notice). My sister and BIL have two toddlers though and they absolutely refuse to get a babysitter. At first I found out they planned on sneaking their kids in, then they wanted to use my parents to watch them which I had to shut down because I want my parents at my wedding. Now they plan on attending the ceremony and saying they both need to leave to watch the kids after. I just don't get why they can't use a babysitter for the 4 hour reception - we have a hotel on site that they could even use. I've offered to pay for the room, pay for a babysitter, and even pay for a camera since they're so concerned about leaving their kids with a babysitter. They could literally walk back and forth from the hotel to reception to check on their kids if they wanted. But nope they'll either attend with their kids or won't attend at all. I'm also not even sure why they want their kids there when the dinner doesn't start until 7pm, neither children are potty trained, there will be no other children, lots of alcohol, no toys/playgrounds/etc, and no kid friendly food options. We've been arguing about this for a year now and it's exhausting.

"I have been dating my wife since we were 19 years old in 2009, we got married while I was in the military in 2014. Now we‚Äôve had our ups and downs as any couple would. But this past year in June 2021 , we  moved back home from across the country after living out west for 8 years to be home with our families, and to hopefully start our own. We sold our home and paid off all our debts and resigned from our jobs , we basically were getting a fresh start in our hometown. We decided to have a wonderful summer together before i started school in the fall (using my GI BiLL) and before she started looking for a career(as she just graduated college). So we got tickets and had a great weekend at country thunder in WI. We stayed the entire weekend and camped and everything was great. Upon coming home from the weekend long concert, I started to get a fever. So concerned over getting covid, i got tested right away. Found out i tested positive. Now i was already scared because My lungs got destroyed while I was in the military. But i couldnt imagine how bad it would eventually become. My wife didnt want me to go to the hospital, as she doesnt trust doctors and said il be fine. I was also unvaccinated because she didnt want me to get vaxxed. Anyways, about 8 days later I forced her to take me to the hospital because I couldnt breathe anymore and my oxygen level dropped below 80 and i was dizzy. I ended up getting intubated 3 days later. I then spent 40 days intubated and on a ventilator to keep me alive. By the grace of god, I survived. But now i woke up and had lost 40 days of my life as well as 50lbs of muscle to atrophy. Literally almost all my muscle basically just rotted away. So i spent another 40 days in the hospital getting taken care of and literally relearning how to sit up , stand, walk, talk etc. i finally left that hospital at the end of october. And i got vaccinated then too. But now i am still recovering as of today, i have a bedsore getting treated and go to therapy every few days still getting my strength back. Now the hospital bills are coming in, and i still cant work and i have nerve damage in both my hands and my left foot, i told my wife at the beginning of march that we may have to use the savings account to pay my hospital bills, as i cant work atm and she isnt. She lost her temper then and said that money was supposed to be for her new car as we sold hers when we moved, she then told me she resents me for getting vaccinated and for ‚Äúmaking her move home‚Äù. now she decided Two weeks ago to kick me out of the house and she emptied my savings account. She also took all my/our silver bullion. And a few days after i was served divorce papers. I am at a loss for words. I thought everything was good in the summer, then i got sick and i feel like i woke up in a different universe. I still cant feel half of my hands from nerve damage and cant stand for longer than a couple minutes. And now my wife left me at my lowest point.I feel as if my foundation has crumbled, like my legs were kicked out from beneath me. And she even took my dog:/ now im stuck living with my parents at 32 yo as i cant support myself yet and shes demanding alimony per the divorce papers even tho i cant work and have piling medical debt and shes got an education ü§¶i dont even know where to start with the healing process. The worst part is, i love her to the moon and back.

"Hey all, wanted some advice. We are pretty set on a venue that includes bar and food (albeit through a separate company). There is a minimum bar tab of $3000 that we are also fine with. However, the contract states there is an automatic 25% gratuity charge for bar service. I have no problem tipping for good service. But even excellent service at a restaurant warrants 20%-22%. An automatic tip of 25% for the bar bill seems like a lot. Am I crazy? Is it rude to attempt to negotiate this? We have estimated an open bar cost of around $4k plus tax. The 25% tip would be another grand on top of that. I realize the difference there is  $200-$400 depending on negotiating it to 15%-20% range. Given that, is this dumb? It just doesn't feel right.

Since then our marriage hasn‚Äôt been the same. I think it died with him. It‚Äôs like walking on eggshells all of the time, his temper is horrific, and there‚Äôs absolutely no emotional connection anymore, we‚Äôre just like two adults who cohabit but barely speak to each other.

But you see it everywhere, dogs included in all things wedding - walking down the aisle, in wedding and engagement photos, in the videography, etc.  We love our dog to pieces but he's a little crazy (that's why we love him).  But because he's a nut and a little anxious, we don't want to be selfish and put him through the distress of wedding shenanigans while also stressing ourselves out. 

We also chose not to include him in our engagement photos because we now live in a state where none of our friends and family are, so we wouldn't have had anyone to come with to take our dog away for some shots by ourselves, etc.  

We're thinking of including him in maybe one casual way on our wedding day, whether it's a little figurine or a photo of him - but nothing too crazy. It can just be hard when it seems like EVERYONE is including their dogs in their weddings and people ask ""are you going to have your dog at the wedding"" or ""is he going to be in your photos"" and when you say no, it's followed by the disappointed and concerned ""oh..."".

"My fiance and I have been together for almost 8 years now, and got engaged this year. We're considering getting married at the courthouse in a year or so, and then doing a big vow renewal or celebration of marriage a couple years down the line - but I also want the classic white dress wedding ...

We want to get legally married sooner because 

* 1. taxes
* 2. I'm in dental school, and I'd like to change my name before getting my license to practice dentistry - it would be a hassle to get my license and graduate, get married soon after, and then have to change my name on everything
* 3. we would like to be husband &amp; wife but we won't have the money for any reception while I am paying $80k a year for school. we likely will not have the money for a proper reception until I work for a year. 

I'm thinking that after we get legally married, I'll graduate from school, be able to work, and make enough money that we can save and plan for a nice big reception/vow renewal/celebration. 

However, I've also always wanted the classic wedding things: saying our vows to each other in front of family and friends, the fancy white dress, the bachelorette/bachelor parties, and most of all, the wedding registry. I'm not going to lie, for years I've been seeing nice things and thinking, ""ooh gonna have that on the wedding registry for sure"" -- to be blunt, I really want this one opportunity to get gifts from random relatives (I don't have a great relationship with most of the relatives that I'm obligated to invite).

We live in the Bible Belt. Spouse‚Äôs parents desperately wanted grandkids from us. I wanted them, too, but it is hard wrap my mind around that now. Spouse sought a partner 10 years my senior, and along with their parents, seeks all we built since we were teenagers.

"Originally posted this to r/Weddingsunder10k, but thought it would be helpful here too. I got married April 10 and I feel like every article I read about saving money just included knowing people who will donate their skills, space or time.

I don't have those kinds of resources but still had an affordable wedding without sacrificing any major aspects! In all, everything cost $4,000. Context: I live in a small town in Oklahoma (not a lot of vendor/venue choices!) and had a 3-hour wedding at a local venue with 50 guests.

Here are a few that helped:

1. **Check the library.** This might sound crazy, but my small-town library has a collection called ""The Library of Things."" Since finding it, I have found that it is not unique, plenty of other libraries have similar collections. They can carry anything from Circuit machines you can use for making decor to things like a typewriter or telescope that work as awesome standalone decorations! My local library also carries a speaker system, karaoke machine and projector, all of which we used. If your library doesn't carry these items, they probably do have a crafting section and/or wedding-related books that can help with planning.
2. **For your bouquets, don't order a bridal or bridesmaid bouquet.** Everything is marked up if it's for a wedding! Instead, request loosely bound seasonal bouquets, maybe with the bridesmaid ones being a little smaller and with more filler. You can always tie it with string or yarn to make it easier to hold. This does mean you are trading off the ability to pick the shape of the bouquet, but the natural look of a more loosely-bound bouquet can also be appealing. Ordering this way, I got my large, brightly colored, beautiful bridal bouquet (photo [here](https://imgur.com/a/yAPgSOA)) for $35 instead of the typical \~$150.
3. **Have your paper products printed at a local print shop!** You may lose some of the fancy options for customizing it or having different types of paper, but wow does it make a difference! It was $10 for a [package](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1099082405/boho-invitation-template-wedding?ref=yr_purchases) on Etsy that included beautiful matching templates for invitations, detail cards and RSVP cards. The local print shop in my small town didn't have any of the ecru or linen paper, but they did have a heavy-weighted card stock. I had 25 of each thing printed, plus bought blank, sturdy envelopes, for $30 total! [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v37Z62SRzQKrVAc0k8li8yCZcclO_Xd_/view) is how they came out. An added benefit is not having to pay shipping costs, which add up! I did not end up using the RSVP cards, instead having people RSVP on our website to save on postage.

"First off, I just want to say that I KNOW this is an incredibly selfish feeling I am having. I'm just not sure where else to vent about it.

My wedding is in a month. Everything is coming together pretty well, but we had a hiccup when my fiance's dad had a stroke right after Christmas. He's recovering well, walking again, even getting started driving again (which is a big deal). However, my soon to be sister-in-law was supposed to play a violin solo for my walk down the aisle, and she ended up becoming his caretaker for quite some time, and she told us she hadn't been able to practice enough and couldn't do it. I was SUPER gracious even though I was incredibly disappointed. 

Now, a second thing has happened. Our wedding ceremony will be outdoors, and originally, it was set to be in this beautiful clearing surrounded by trees about a third of a mile from the reception building. My future father-in-law JUST told us this week that he doesn't feel comfortable walking to the site. I KNOW it's not his fault, but we've had to move it to the lawn near the building, which I don't like nearly as much. 

Again, I know I am being super selfish here. But I am just so disappointed that I have had to give up two things that are very important to me, especially this close to the date.

"So long story short I‚Äôm still in my divorce. Just passing a year. Paying child support.  She said she only wants me to have the kids every other weekend and Wednesdays for a few hours.  I want 50/50 and she thinks the girls are best with her. I‚Äôve missed out this pass year on putting them to bed. Making breakfast. Taking them to school. Being involved in their lives. It‚Äôs so hard. 

When they are with me I feel more like a baby sitter so she can get a break. I spend the whole time with them. They can have friends over but can‚Äôt spend the night at friends. I feel bad for that. My time is little. 

When it comes to after school things,therapy, or Dr. Appts. She wants me to do all the running around while she‚Äôs at work.  Which in turn makes me feel like a taxi driver.

"This is a follow up to my post from a few days ago.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/tztea6/is\_my\_wife\_having\_a\_mid\_life\_crisis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/tztea6/is_my_wife_having_a_mid_life_crisis/)

Gave her the space she wanted during her trip to Germany.   Just spoke to her over video chat earlier and kept it civil.  She was still in the same mood she was when she left.     
Then shortly after the call I got a text message from her saying we are not good together and that it's not fair to our daughter and that we are better apart.   

I haven't been served with any type of papers.   I haven't noticed any unusual activities on her banking account or her attempting to cut me off.    


Like I said before with what the lawyer said, the system is designed to be challenging but not impossible to get a divorce.  It will cost both parties a LOT of money and that's why they hope that the couples will figure out how to reconcile their differences before going that route.

Many of you said that 7.5k retainer fee was really high for a divorce case.    Can anyone recommend an  attorney that's more affordable in the Northern VA area?  I don't want to be served with papers and be forced into signing a separation agreement  because I can't afford to fight it.   I need to be able to defend my self from her demands that will leave me with nothing.   

My biggest concern is my daughter and how she will process this situation.   She already knows something is going on between us that is not good.  She is already showing signs of negativity towards us.   I am trying to address the possibility that she has ADHD but my wife is ignoring it and she is struggling as a result of it.     


Part of me thinks maybe she is right, that all this is my fault.   When our daughter was born we both agreed that she was number 1 priority now and that we are number 2.   I am so confused as to why my wife is now claiming that she has been unhappy for 6 years even though she wanted to have another child with me 2 years ago.  A lot of you said that it no longer matters and it makes me sad as I always wanted to help but she always shut me out and kept secrets from me, which led to more arguments.    Maybe I should have just kept my mouth shut and go by, ""Happy wife , happy life"" mentality and maybe things wouldn't have gotten this bad.     


I don't think she fully understands how expensive this will get and that it is going to cost both of us more to be divorced than for us to work on reconciliation.    I am afraid for my daughter's safety if she tries to push my buttons and starts arguments in order for me to act violently against her so she can call the cops on me to get me out of the house.   There is so much my daughter wants to do with the three of us as a family and there is so much I want to show my daughter.   Wife just feels like her work is her life and daughter doesn't matter that much.   She already claimed that because her parents were divorced around the same age as our daughter that she will turn out alright, but ever case is different.

"So there are very very limited venue options near my family home. Typically people getting married there will either reserve at the local country club or put up a tent on the village green. I have several guests, including my mom, who have mobility issues that would make the tent problematic, so we reserved the country club last July, for a July wedding this year.

Well. Funny story, when we reserved the club, no one mentioned that it would be undergoing a massive renovation (like, a full gut job, interior entirely reconfigured). They also did not mention that the club's general manager, executive chef, AND event planner (the person I was emailing with) were all retiring. We learned about all of this from my parents and other friends in town around Christmastime.

My fiance and I went to my parents' for spring break with plans to go see the new reconfigured space and it is still completely under construction, and the space that has typically been used for ceremonies has been turned into what is going to be a bar space that will be open to club members during the event. The dining room is way smaller than it was (they swear it can still hold 125 but if that's true it's going to be cramped af, and if it's not true I'm going to have to uninvite people we sent save the dates to!) and when I asked the (retiring) event planner about where a ceremony could be held she looked around and said ""huh...I guess the architects didn't think about that when they finalized the plans"". I asked when we could expect the space to be finished, and she said that they were ""pretty sure"" it would be done by Memorial Day (end of May if you're not in the US) but that they weren't sure the furniture would be getting there in time and the outside space ""might not"" be finished. I asked when we could start talking about pinning down the menu, since we need to send invitations very soon, and she said that the new general manager would be taking over in mid-April and that he would be hiring the new chef so they wouldn't be planning anything until then. I asked when HER replacement would be available and same story. ""Can we have open flames? Can we have wall decor? Can we...."" was all met with ""Well, that's something you'll have to talk about with my replacement.""

Now, to be clear--there really are no other options at this point. The place where we could potentially have put up a tent is reserved for another event by this point, and the alternative would be, like, a pavilion in a state park, which is beautiful, but inaccessible for our guests with disabilities. So, we're stuck with this country club, but I am worried sick a) that the work isn't really going to be done by our mid-July date and b) that even if the space is done, we're not going to be able to fit all of our planned guests and coordinate everything we need to coordinate with them until way after we have to send our invitations, and will have to come up with something unsatisfactory for the ceremony (like, it could be in the dining room itself, but I'd really wanted a separate space--I'd wanted THE space that was there before!). And based on the plans they shared with us seating really is going to be a nightmare. I guess the answer is to plan on going buffet and just ask guests on their RSVPs about dietary restrictions rather than food preferences? And then pray that they come up with some kind of solution for the ceremony space? 

Anyway--I know it's really about the marriage and the people we're celebrating with and at the end of the day that's all that matters, not a specific aesthetic vision. But I'm spitting mad that this wasn't all disclosed to us when we reserved the space, and maybe never would have been if I hadn't contacted them after hearing about it from other sources. And I am furious that they're not making an effort to help us with what we need to get done on our timeline. It's just so frustrating. Thanks for letting me vent!",Need to vent!

"We were in a bedroom together. A room I've never seen, but it felt like 'ours'. It had our four cats running around, and an extra white one. No kids. It felt like 'us' before we had kids, the trauma of a special needs kid, covid, post partum depression, mental health issues, and the chaos that destroyed us.   


I realized it was basically just a dream about us before we got married. It was a memory as much as it was a dream. Sad really. How something as simple as a dream about our past felt like a little taste of heaven.  I woke up, wishing I could talk to my stbxw like I was talking to her in the dream. No drama. No hate. No chaos.

It's been 5 months now since we've separated after a horrible argument. Both of my cats are dead. One of hers recently died. The remainder is rehomed because my stbxw changed and started hating the cats and wanted to get rid of them. I miss that cat, too.  I've been through counseling, attacked the gym, got my self esteem back, and have had time to reflect. I feel like this dream was my brain letting me see things from a distance.

"Hey y'all, 

I'm having a destination wedding in a location that I don't live close to and can't easily travel to oversee vendors. Because of this, I'm looking into planners or month of coordinators to help with the process. 

So far, I've noticed a few of them have clauses stating that the client gives them permission to use photos for marketing. I don't have an issue with this at all. However, I am concerned about the level that some of these clauses go to. Here are some examples:

Partial Planner's contract:

&gt;*The event and the planning process is work product produced by the Planner. The Planner retains all rights to the planning and production of this event to include the rights to documents and images produced.*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*- The Planner reserves the right to obtain any images from the event from the professional photographer and/or videographer and use in the Planner's marketing and media (including though not limited to website, social media and literature.)*  
*- The Client agrees to allow images from the professional photographer and/or videographer to be distributed to the Planner and to be used in the Planner's media (including though not limited to website, social media and literature.)*  
*- The Client agrees to distribute images from the professional photographer and/or videographer to the Planner if requested.*

&amp;#x200B;

A different Month of Coordinator's clause:

&gt;*Client agrees that Planner may take and use any and all photographs and video from the event, taken by Planner, planner staff, other vendors or the photographer, in its promotions, on social media, websites, and similar mediums without prior approval by Client or without any compensation. Planner requests that Client tag Planner in social media postings regarding the event. Client is responsible for sending the photos by the photographer within 7 days of receiving them to AKhappenings via email. Photo galleries (along with any required passwords) can be sent to \[email address\]*

Again, I have no issues with vendors using materials to market - I get that it's a huge way for them to drum up business. But to require access to a full gallery? That seems extreme. What if there are intimate moments I don't want to be shared? How can I give blanket permission to redistribute photos I don't own the copyright to?

I've asked both vendors to give more details about these clauses but I just wanted to check: am I overreacting here? Has anyone else dealt with this?

"When does the time come that you say the words. What is the catalyst that makes them spill from your mouth into real life flesh and blood?

I have wanted a divorce for a while. Years actually. But I don't hate her and the marriage is not toxic. It's just broken and sucks the life from both of us. I have wanted out for years. 

But that thought just stayed in the way back of my mind as kind of a fantasy. A nice to dream about but I know I never will place. And the days turn to weeks turn to years.

We have bad days and we have good days. The good days always seem to be enough to convince me to hang on. Wait out the next rough patch. Maybe there is light around the next corner. It's a long story of childhood abuse and trauma and PTSD. I can't fault her for that can I. And she has really been working at it for the past 10 months with a new therapist.

But nothing is changing and we are as distant as ever. More so than ever. And I am lonely and empty and a shell of a man in my own home.

So this thought of divorce that has existed so comfortably in the recesses of my mind has been gaining precious ground. It has been staking claim to my cognitive though. It moved from ""I know I never will"" to ""I could right now if I had the balls.""

But then the hesitation creeps back in. What about the kids? What about the finances? What about retirement? No way I could actually pull it off and have any form of a happy life.

The bad days grow bigger and push the thought closer to the front. 4 weeks ago I though it was going to happen. I never said it out loud, but I was researching how to file. She admitted later that she though I was going to walk in with papers. We ended up at her therapy session together and I was convinced to stick it out a little more. ""She had come a long way... but still has a long way to go"" I was told.

And we did have a few good days after that. But the bad tads took back over. And yesterday I was in the shower and I had a surreal experience detaching from my body and watching myself walk out into the living room and say the words. It was one of the most real things I have felt. But I did not do it.

But the words feel like gravel in my mouth. Like they are bouncing around and one day are just going to topple out now matter the consequence. I don't want to loose the house and kids. I don't want to cut my income in half. But I don't want to be married. And one day the words are going to take over and speak themselves.

""This marriage is not working. I love you, but we have not been in love for a very long time. It is time to move on."" I would say.

I don't know why I did not say it yesterday. maybe because it's not the kind of thing you say on a Monday afternoon. And today was better and the words not so close to coming out. I can give her one more therapy session... I can wait to the weekend... Or maybe until summer.... But 2022 is it... Or maybe a breakthrough is just ahead...

And just like that the days have turned to months have turned to 17 years. And with each cycle of good day and bad day, the words come closer to coming out.

"Hey Everyone,

My wife and I are currently a few months into the divorce process (I served her divorce papers 3 weeks ago).  I wouldn't exactly call this amicable se because we both have attorneys and she's refused to discuss even the most basic terms of settlement (asset division, custody, etc.).  For those that have gone through or are going through the divorce process currently, how did you handle your involvement in family chat groups (Whatsapp, iMessage, Telegram, etc.)?  I'm on maybe 3-4 different family groups with my wife's relatives.  I don't think that she's really told her extended family about our marital issues, so if I was to leave those chat groups, then they'd probably suspect that something is awry.

In a sense, since my wife is unwilling to be reasonable during this process, I kind of just want to say ""fuck it"", leave those groups, and move forward with my life.  The only downside is that she'll probably get blasted with, ""Hey...is everything okay?  We saw that your hubby left our chat groups?""

my cousin is newly engaged and having an engagement party in April. the invite says ""cocktail attire"". I think I have a reasonable idea of what that means, but nothing I own currently would suit that dress code.

I don't have a lot of money, so I'm looking at second hand or clearance dresses. if I find something that fits with the dress code and wear it to the engagement party, can I also wear it to the wedding if the wedding dress code isn't something extreme like black tie? we don't know when the wedding will be yet, I doubt they know (of course, they might have a tiny wedding that I'm not invited to, but I think it's unlikely). I would feel a lot better about spending money on a dress if I know I'll be able to wear it more than once (I don't wear nice dresses in my everyday life, only for things like christmas or milestone birthday parties). if I wore it to both I would wear it with different accessories.

I feel like it would be rude, but I also have sensory issues about fabric that makes clothes shopping a nightmare, so I'm afraid of not finding anything else when it comes time to buy an outfit for the wedding - or that I might still be unemployed then and not be able to afford a second nice dress. but I would feel even more rude to not go to the wedding purely because I have nothing to wear!

"TLDR: Need Hong Kong specific advice on whether a friend can move out with his and his wife's baby before a divorce because we're concerned the mother is posing a danger to him and the baby.

Hi all, posting on behalf of a friend to see if someone here can help give some advice. My friend and his wife live in Hong Kong, where his wife is from. They have been married for about 3 years and have a 6 months old baby together. 

The relationship has always been a bit turbulent but my friend is now seeking divorce because his wife has become verbally and physically abusive. He has photos of bruises and scratches from when she attacked him and managed to record her shouting abuse at him. During pregnancy she also threatened to kill the baby. My friend is the sole breadwinner, he pays for everything from bills to rent for their flat. 

My friend has already contacted social services and is waiting for an appointment with the public lawyer but in the meantime we're very concerned for his and the baby's safety. It seems social services treat it as a bit of a joke because he's a big guy and she's quite small. Does anyone know what the legal situation is? Woulds my friend be within his right to move out and take the baby with him (not leaving Hong Kong, just the shared flat because it's unsafe)?

Granted I was a young little shit and honestly don't remember much about it but I know that the way she is feeling right now will only get worse and we are both pretty simple people so I know that she would have just as good of a time going this route with far less stress. 

My lady has bad anxiety and I'd like to take some of the load off her shoulders with some suggestions for things like packages and all that as we are from Canada(aware of marrying in US things to beware) as she is already getting a bit burnt out by it as she is also working full time at the hospital. So basically I'd like to know anyone willing to share, their experience with Vegas elopments more geared towards desert packages and who they used and any tips or info they could shed including tips for a Canadian doing this in America. ANY help would be supremely appreciated even if it's telling me to kick rocks because at this point I'm just trying to keep her in as good of a place as possible .

"In January of 2021 my FIL suddenly passed away. MIL &amp; SIL were being extra and essentially my husband went over to MIL 4-5 days a week.  I am in a nursing school and because of my SIL and MIL it became super distracting. I never saw my husband. I made the decision to withdraw for the semester to help the family as best I could. 

January 2022 and 2 weeks before my last semester starts my husband said he was done. I don't know anymore details, I do know my MIL and SIL persuaded him to leave. 

My mom has Alzheimers and yesterday she fell in the shower. My dad is placing her in a nursing home this weekend. I'm going home to help him and I am just angry at my husband right now. Husband knew my mom had been declining. How can he do this to me after I gave him everything for his family when his dad died?

"Hello! I've been with my husband (13 years my senior) since I was 22. I'm now 32. Our relationship isn't hard in the typical sense - we both make good money, have no kids, and typically get along. That being said, our relationship is so surface level. 

He's the same person he was when he was 18 - the idea of self-reflection and growth is something that he scoffs at. Because he can't self-reflect, everything in our relationship has either been my responsibility or my fault. He's codependent and definitely does the guilt trip / mopey thing. Mindset-wise, we're on different planets. He lets life happen to him and takes no initiative to change the things he doesn't like in his life. I have zero sexual interest in him. I have more productive and meaningful conversations with my colleagues.

After a particularly mind-numbing argument in September, I decided to give myself a year to leave. It was like all of my lifelong depression and anxiety were immediately lifted. My dad is moving out of his apartment in CA (where I'm from) after buying a house out of state. He knows about my stance on my marriage and offered to let me take his place for a month since he'll have a month left on his lease. 

So for the last month, I've been telling people - my mom, aunt, colleagues, and bosses. Neither of them are close with my husband, and him finding out from them isn't a concern. I've been telling people as a means of keeping myself accountable. I'll have the conversation with him about divorce once I'm there, but I think I need to gently lead with a request for a break first. 

I know there's going to come a day here in about a month and a half where I Just have to tell him that I'm packing my car and driving to California for a month. He is going to absolutely lose it. I don't know why this feels like such a barrier to me, but it does. I don't hate him and I don't resent him, so the idea of hurting him and shocking him in that way really gets to me on occasion. 

Can you guys tell me about how you left your spouses who weren't terrible people or who didn't commit some unforgivable crime? At this point, there's no stopping this moving train - it's going to happen. I Just have no idea how to approach the conversation and would love to hear of other's experiences.

"I'm at a point where I should be cancelling the wedding and ending the relationship but instead, I'm on reddit ranting about it before I give a call to my therapist.

Me and my fianc√©, we come from 2 different muslim backgrounds with very similar and open upbringings. We've been together for over 10+ years and we're getting married this summer.

Him: a finance guy, rational, down to business, no fuss, sometimes a bit detached from his emotions but a very kind and loving person. He has a traditional side with a very feminist outlook that he has never hidden from me.

Me: a huge mix of rational and dreamy. stubborn and sometimes quite unsure of myself. 

Where I grew up, our weddings are exactly like American. White gown, party, etc. They have traditional weddings where bride goes through several traditional outfits throughout the night. I always dreamt of my wedding dress, my bouquet and my veil all that. 

I personally would have been much more happier with a very small destination wedding or an elopement. For him, getting married and having a wedding is a duty to his parents so we decided to have an engagement in my hometown (a small dinner), civil ceremony where we live and a big wedding + the religious ceremony in his hometown. 

I picked out my wedding gown and he told me to go with my heart's desire, spare no expenses. He asked to see the dress and absolutely loved it. It's a gorgeous mermaid with a detachable train. I first thought, I'd wear it to our civil ceremony without the train. But him and SIL said that would be a bit weird. It's better be kept for the big party. Then during the wedding preparations, I noticed how they were trying to put my dress to last, thus making me spend the least amount of time wearing it. Basically just to close the ceremony and cut the cake. I opposed to it saying I want to enjoy my dress and dance in it. Through the prep meetings, my fianc√© took a very stern approach towards the issue and everything surrounding it. He was telling me stuff like ""do as you told, you don't get an opinion, this is not for you, this is for family"" it's not like him. When it was time to decide my hairstyle, I opted for a half up and half down instead of a bun. And he said that it looks like an every day style, not even refined, not wedding like, not worth going to the hairdresser's for.

I had a chat with SIL and she says that he can't say anything about the hair but she made a point about the whole dress debacle. She says that according to the people in that country white dress, train and veil means Christian wedding in church. And despite being Middle Eastern I have very European features: light skin, dark blonde hair etc. Everyone will think I'm European if I highlight my white dress. She also said that she wished I was more willing to embrace my own culture. 

Issue with that is, they have a caricature of an idea of my culture and this is what they want to highlight. I tried to explain that for the last 200 years women in my country got married in white gowns even though they understood they offered a compromise that I put designs on my white gown that resemble our traditional embroidery. Also, my fianc√© tried to make me buy a caricaturized ""traditional"" dress to wear to my wedding which I hated so I tried to cut that part as short as possible. It's also very difficult to find artisans that work with that style because it is a thing of history books. Imagine that I'm French and they want me to dress like Marie Antoinette.

Another compromise was to ditch the train which is ok and maybe do a 50/50 with 2 traditional dresses from their culture and 2 of my dresses 1 traditional 1 white. Then I'll definitely arrange a photoshoot in my gown whether my fianc√© chooses to join me or not. 

I want to confront my fianc√© about it but deep down I know that it all stems from him being protective of me, trying to protect me from rumours of his extended family. Despite being together for all that time, I only met a few uncles and cousins and the rest of the family is very curious about me. For the record, because of my looks I've been asked if I'm European during those meetings and their culture isn't very open to marrying out. Thank you if you read up until this point. I really needed to get it off of my chest.",Dress Drama,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning
"Additional Child Care: Should either party be unable to care for the minor child during the time the minor child is scheduled for regular access with that parent, that custodial parent may, if they choose, first offer the time to the non-custodial parent before securing childcare and the parent who is scheduled to have the minor child will solely bear the cost of the childcare. The custodial parent will provide the non-custodial parent with notice of childcare information if it is used, complete with schedules and the name, address, and telephone number of the childcare provider, as available.

"You may argue, things may not be easy, she may never give you a blowjob and he may never clean up after himself. 

But if the two of you have kid/s... I beg you, don't do this. There is no such thing as divorce for kid's sake, pathological situations aside - I mean violence and sexual abuse only.

I'm a specialist here since not only my parents, but also my grandparents are divorced. It's been decades since both, but both affect to this very day my relationships with my grandfather, my mother, my father. 

People always find new partner after divorce (logical) and the new partner NEVER accepts the kid. It can be just lowkey (I've heard a story how mother's partner was infuriated by her son's laughter and anytime a boy (16 y.o.) laughed, the man would sigh in fury and leave the room ostentatiously). 

It can be severe - in most cases of infant abuse (such as beating a newborn to death / black and blue) that you see on the TV it was mother's partner. The partner may also be sexually abusive towards teenage daughter. 

Women are more sophisticated in this, but trust me - they hate the kid as well. Women want to keep partner's money from child of divorce. This happens especially when a woman has kids with him - she wants HER kids with him to come out better that the kid of an ex-wife. It may be only on subconscious level. 

She will try HER kids with him to get the most of his time, money, love, affection. That being said, she frowns upon him contacting the child. He's already gotten divorce once and he's not doing this again, so he remains tacit and does what she wants him to. They may never speak about it outright, but most of human communication is extra-verbal.

She also may play the nice aunt role, which would conflict the child with his own mother. 

Also, parents of divorce have other kids in the families they're with and these kids are ALWAYS treated better than the child of divorce, because that's basically no one's child now. This takes toll on the child of divorce mental health. 

In almost all cases I've seen, the child loses it's bond with one or both parents and they either not talk at all or they sometimes have a chat about the weather on the phone, which is far from parental bonding. 

Divorced parents are impoverished by divorce and are less willing to provide for the kid - extra curricular activities, vacation, etc. so the kid ends up being poor, plus they are not able to establish discipline, especially in teenage years. 

In cases of shared custody, the kid is moved from house to house like in this hot potato game and does not feel at home in any of these houses, cannot find himself, etc. 

When it comes to grandchildren, fathers of divorce are not active grandparents, as they usually have younger wives and young offsprings, almost at the age of the grandkid, so they focus on being a parent, rather than being a grandparent and their wife is very jealous if they spend time being a grandparent. 

Even toxic environments in two-parent househholds are still better than the divorce shit that's a curse for life. Don't do this. A divorce is not a storm , then the rainbow. It's a car accident when you end up in a wheelchair and you're still in this wheelchair no matter how many years it's been. It's a permanent situation, a rupture. It's not a wound that heals with time. It's a life sentence.

Now I know most of y'all will say ""but I'm not that kind of a stepmother/ stepfather/ step-grandmother / my partner is different / my situation is different"". NO, IT'S NOT. You know why? Because people are still animals. Females don't like their kids or them sharing the mammoth with some brat. Males don't want to foster offspring that's not theirs, they resent them as it's another male's offspring and they don't wish him well. It's basic instinct and from what I see, people are not able to raise above it. I don't mean they don't want to or find it hard to. I mean they are not able. 

And this blended family bulshit? It's a joke. There's a reason why porn revolves around step families mostly. Because step families are a joke.

"This community is helping me through a tough time. I‚Äôd be grateful to hear subjective opinions on a recent development in my separation. 

We‚Äôve been together ten years and married for eight. She was on Prozac for years to manage depression and admitted she had attempted suicide before we got together. We endured ups and downs in her moods and I supported her the best I could. She stopped medication a few years ago and things actually seemed great for a while. 

Cut to 2021. She‚Äôs clearly having manic episodes and really low lows. (She‚Äôs also a T1 diabetic so that often got scapegoated for her being cranky, fatigued, etc.). In October she tells me she feels disconnected from me and doesn‚Äôt know what to do. I ask if she wants to separate and, despite retracting it later, said it might be for the best. She blames her mental health and adamantly swears I had done nothing wrong. In a weird way that felt worse, because I could at least work on or try to fix an issue if I shared the blame. 

Three weeks ago I‚Äôm cooking dinner and she tells me that she needs space and leaves. I ask again if she wants to separate and if there‚Äôs anything I can do to help. Any problem or issue I can own up to. Again, I get the ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs me‚Äù response. She packed a bag and moved in with her parents and I‚Äôve only spoken to her a handful of times since, usually about logistics like taxes or the house. 

One of the few times I got her over to the house to talk (something she tried to postpone multiple times), I told her that I‚Äôve demonstrated my commitment to the relationship in big and small ways and haven‚Äôt felt that commitment back in a long time. She agreed. I told her I don‚Äôt want to divorce but don‚Äôt know how to convince someone to reinvest in a relationship or make me a priority again. She agreed again. I encouraged her to see a therapist (something she‚Äôs canceled or put off for ages) but told her I don‚Äôt think that will cure our relationship. There‚Äôs no magic medicine or therapist that‚Äôs going to make someone fall in love again. I‚Äôm sure her mental health played a big role in her leaving and withdrawing the way she did, but this was the first time her mental health was mentioned as a reason she doesn‚Äôt want to be together anymore. 

We were texting about a repair that needs to be made to the house and she mentioned she saw a psychiatrist for the first time in years and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (not surprised, but it‚Äôs definitely an update after just treating depression in the past.) She said she was going to start a new med soon. 

I don‚Äôt want to give up on us too quickly but I don‚Äôt see this diagnosis explaining away everything that‚Äôs happened. Is that a fair statement? Has anyone else dealt with an unstable ex? What can be treated and what can‚Äôt?

"Not a throwaway, but an alt account, for obvious reasons

I (35 F) have been married to my STBX (32M) for 8 years. I had bad luck in the past, and he was relocating from Canada to TX to be with me, so I had us start couple's therapy right out the gate. He was definitely on board, just the whole idea that we should learn the tools we need before we need them.

Everything was going really well for the first few years, but about 3 years ago he started getting really distant. He has ADHD (we both do) and his executive dysfunction is a beast, but this went beyond that. He started spending all his time playing solo games or watching youtube, and I tried to get involved and interested in what he was gravitating towards, but he would just zone out whenever we spoke. Obviously disconnecting emotionally. 

Around that time, my workload got really insane and I thought that maybe he needed some more time for himself, so this gave us that option. Except now that I was so tired, I was never in the mood for sex. I don't mean that I wouldn't be interested, I mean that I could never get out of Work Brain on my own so I wasn't initiating. I talked to him about this over and over and over again, even with our therapist and each time he talked this big game saying that he was going to help rekindle the intimacy. But then as soon as he was done talking, it's like his brain went ""Job done, gg"" and there was zero actual followthrough with anything.

He also was really bad financially. We make the same amount, but when we divided bills, he never remembered to pay them and we would get the internet or the water shut off or late fees so I started covering ALL the bills and just gave him a set amount to contribute. He also somehow managed to overdraft pretty religiously. Every paycheck he'd go in the red, just on food or snacks or dumb nickle and dime stuff. 

And then... Well, we were working to fix his credit score. We got it up high enough that he could qualify for a credit card entirely in his name. The idea was he would buy one thing a month and pay it off and keep a balance of as close to 0 as possible to slowly improve the score. I was going to be hands off on this, completely.

After about 6 months, I started seeing his credit card statements coming in with these ominious envelopes with red borders and PAST DUE and all that fun stuff. I had to dog him to get him to tell me what was going on. Apparently he'd used the credit card to buy loot boxes and in-game items for a few games he plays and maxed out the credit card. It had a limit of 10K... He spent $10,000 on loot boxes and cosmetic items for a handful of MMOs... And guess who had to help figure that bill out. On top of all the other household expenses. 

Our therapist recommended he do one on one therapy with her, which was short-lived because he would either forget or not have the money for it. And every time we made a plan, he still wouldn't follow through. When I asked him *why* he said that it was because it 'sounded really hard to fix' and if there was a chance of him failing, then he wasn't going to even start. 

I kept trying, and I was leaning on some of my friends for support. Eventually I was leaning on a few of them for the emotional connections I wasn't getting with him anymore, and I realized I was starting to get feelings for one of my friends. The day I realized, I pulled him aside and told him that something was really wrong and we needed to fix this, because I was getting feelings for other people and that's not the way I am comfortable in relationships. I told him that we *had to fix this* or else I don't know what was going to happen between us.

His response was that because I am bi and the friend is female, that it isn't fair to me to shut down that whole part of my identity, so as long as it's just another female, then he's fine with an open marriage. I told him that's great, but I am NOT okay with an open marriage, I want to fix the marriage I have right now. He just patted himself on the back for being so accommodating.

Not long after, it hit me all at once that I'm not happy. I talked to our therapist about it, and she said that she's seen that he's not willing to work on this, so if I'm not happy, we should split. That blew me away. But I told him that I wanted a divorce and he was just very blase about it. It didn't upset him or phase him -- until I kicked him out of the master bedroom and made him move into the guest room. And made him get his own car. And his own phone plan. And stopped doing his laundry or cleaning up after him.

But now whenever I try to make him talk to me about dividing the assets, he gets squirrelly and disappears. He still doesn't have his finances under control, even though I've told him that at some point he's going to have to move out. He generally doesn't have $5 to his name -- not exaggerating. 

But mostly, I'm destroyed that he just... doesn't seem to care. There isn't another person that I'm aware of. He's really bad at making friends and meeting people, so with a few very recent exceptions, his friends are my friends. I just... don't understand. I don't get how I can mean so little to him. The last time I had to corner him about starting the paperwork, he told me that I was triggering him because it just made him feel like he failed and he said that I know he has a fear of failure and shouldn't have brought it up. ...Buddy, you DID fail. You're continuing to fail! I wish I'd said that..

So now I don't know what to do. I bought a house that was finalized shortly after we were married, everything else I kept separate because I had a feeling... No children, but we have animals. I wanted to do a DIY divorce, but now seeing the FAQ here I'm not sure that's a good idea. It would be tight, but I could maybe find a lawyer if I could figure out how to start. But there's no way in hell HE can afford a lawyer and he's too passive to fight about any of this.

I don't know what to do. I'm lost and I feel worthless and screwed over and I want him gone, but he pays just enough of the bills that it would put me in a tight spot to make him move out. I don't know if I just need to vent or advice or all of the above, but I will say that writing it out made me realize how crap this has been... This really hurts in so many different ways, and I still feel responsible for him, but I didn't sign up to raise a manchild...",Asked for divorce - I think he's in denial and it's tearing me up,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

While I have a job that will likely put me outside the financial aid limits, my finances have been wrecked by a very costly divorce and I pay for a larger part of the kids' costs   

My understanding is that I will be the only parent to fill out the FAFSA - and that he will not have to.   I am worried that he will take this to mean, that I will be responsible for college costs if the college determines that I am not eligible for aid.    I am hoping to not have the kids burdened with large debt - and hope to use some savings, some loans, and hopefully merit aid.  

We have 529's for both that do not contain a whole lot - they are currently in his name, but per our agreement, I can request 1/2 be transferred to a separate 529 that I am cust of.    Does it make sense to leave all 529 assets as is so that they are not included in consideration for any aid?

I am hopeful that he will be cooperative and try to contribute as much as he can, but based on past experiences - I am doubtful.    Our agreement calls for us to each pay for one year at the state school rate - not sure if that is the state flagship or other state schools.

I said give me time I just need love. I was told that I needed to work on myself and her love would come. It didn‚Äôt for 5 months, I checked out. Here recently (7-8 months later) since she couldn‚Äôt give an answer I let her know I wanted a separation. Now she is ready to fix the marriage, try retreats, counselors, get always. Is touching me, wanting me etc.  Recently She said she meant that she wanted the marriage but didn‚Äôt want the marriage if it was going to be like it was the whole time.

I need help to know why? Why now? I‚Äôve stayed through a lot of bs to work things out and this was my breaking point. Why, when she could‚Äôve acted this way in the beginning?  Why when I‚Äôve finally had enough she begins to act like my wife without conditional love. Why am I the bad guy for wanting this? My head is so f*cked right now.

"Hi there, I am in the process of trying to plan a small home reception and I don‚Äôt know where to start at all. 
My husband and I ended up getting married this past September at a music festival (fun out of the box way to get married thought it would be better than just a quick court wedding) and now he wants to have some sort of receptionsque party with family since we did not have anyone at our actual wedding. I have found a large house we were thinking of renting for the weekend for it and to accommodate people (looking to have a total of 40 people or less) coming out of town/needing a place to stay. Other than that I feel like I am at a standstill with it all. 
I really would prefer a casual get together since I do not like to be center of attention. I am not sure how or what type of food to serve and if I should look into any sort of entertainment or to just set things up outside.

"I‚Äôve been back home since November. At first it was great, felt good to be near family, but now I‚Äôm feeling like this isn‚Äôt where I need to be long term. My husband and I don‚Äôt have kids and we‚Äôre going through marriage counseling to see if what we have is salvageable. After such a difficult stretch I‚Äôm really hoping we can make it work‚Ä¶but even if we don‚Äôt, I still want to leave. 

My hometown brings back a lot of sad feelings. I went through a lot of trauma here. It‚Äôs always ‚Äúgood‚Äù to be home but I had to move home to understand that I‚Äôm no longer the person I once was when I left. 

Being back and separating from my husband has helped me reconnect with WHO I AM and MY DREAMS. Not the dreams of my spouse or the dreams of family. It‚Äôs been empowering and I‚Äôm thankful for it but I‚Äôm also terrified. How can I move again?? What will people think?? Will they support my husband and I if we make it work?? 

It‚Äôs been confusing and lonely. 

If I didn‚Äôt have the anxiety of family, I‚Äôd start planning my next city (so I can actually buy a house and not rent like I am now. My home state is soooo expensive) but I feel so guilty for leaving again. I know I need to get over it and just do what makes me happy but all of this shit is a process.

"I picked up my dress from the seamstress today and unfortunately I hate the changes they made to it. I have a tulle gown from Anthropologie. When I tried it on in store, the silhouette was slimmer ‚Äî the tulle was more relaxed from many try-ons. I said that I was worried about it being too poofy and princessy and they assured me that I could have a layer of tulle removed. 

When I took it in for alterations, I said that I wanted it to be less poofy. They assured me that getting it shortened would help and that I didn‚Äôt need to remove a layer of tulle. They told me I needed a bustle. I agreed to it all because I don‚Äôt know anything about dresses!

Well, maybe I‚Äôm an idiot but I didn‚Äôt realize a bustle meant a train. I didn‚Äôt want a train, but the finished dress has one. I thought it was just going to be shortened all the way around, but they gave it a dress mullet and now I have all this fabric dragging behind me and a skirt that‚Äôs still poofier than I wanted. It‚Äôs all much more princess-y and less (for lack of a better term) Greek goddess-y than I was hoping for. 

Is there any way to salvage this? Because I‚Äôm non confrontational I told them it was beautiful and took it home with me. My wedding is a month away.

"Recently my husband has been coming home with a different attitude. Lately everyday we‚Äôve fought and we‚Äôve said rude hurtful things, but I think today he crossed a line. At a certain point of the relationship you have to know when to just give up. (A little backstory) I got pregnant a year into our relationship and for the most part I was really happy. I thought we both were. Well today after fighting about us buying a house we were given the question ‚Äòhow many bedrooms?‚Äô , now the question was simple the answer more difficult. He said three and I said four. We‚Äôve talked about how many kids we want for future reference and all of the above. The deal was one girl and one boy, but if we had two boys we would try for the girl the last time. So in conclusion three kids at max. I was fairly satisfied, but today my husband said he only wanted two kids and that was final. Now I know I am not being dramatic, where is the consideration of my thoughts and feelings? I brought it up again tonight and as we were fighting he shouted and I quote ‚Äò I was practically forced with the first kid, I didn‚Äôt  have a choice so i‚Äôm telling you now I don‚Äôt want three kids.‚Äô FORCED !?! Correct me if i‚Äôm wrong but unless you have a gun to your fucking head no one forced shit on you. He could‚Äôve walked out, he could‚Äôve consulted me and asked me to think about other options.

"   My ex ghost the marriage while working overseas. He never returned to see the children and me. I have not physically seen this man in 4 years. He announced his desire for divorce in the following manner,"" I don't want to talk about the marriage THING."". Anywho. I said,""okay"". Hard stop. Never attempted any forms of reconciliation. Instead, I endured a grueling, mind-bending crushing process for 2.7 years. I'm pretty sure I had a nervous breakdown. 

We have a daughter together. She's 18. Her experience has been more severe than my own throughout all of this. 1-month after he announced he wanted a divorce her behavior spiraled into an abyss. She was expelled from school less than 1 month after his announcement that he wants a divorce and wants to be selfish. (His words, not mine).  I immediately got her into counseling. Her counselor saw her twice a week. 3rd appointment, the counselor calls me in during the session and my daughter told me she had been cutting. I feel physically ill even trying to fathom what kind of pain my baby was carrying to cut herself. That October, a few months later she attempted suicide. She was hospitalized. His Command paid for his ticket home on emergency leave to be with her. He did not come to see her until 1 week after her discharge. He remained in Korea. When he did come to see her, he was drunk from sun up til sundown. He dropped her off every morning drunk. I come downstairs liquor bottles everywhere, he's passed out every day. At night he's vomiting, peeing on the floor, club level blaring music as he yelled and laughed,"" I'm a functional drunk and I like it!"". Stripping naked lamenting about how everyone calls him names and outlining his over 40+ affairs (his count not mine) of unprotected sex he's had in Korea with married women, Koreans, etc. Finally, I got him out of the house and back to whence he came. I let him stay because she needed him desperately. My mistake was not realizing until too late NO ONE need a person who thinks and live that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward. She completes intensive therapy, she and I move to another state. New start. It was a bit rocky. She overcame a LOT of emotional obstacles to get to the point that she was able to graduate early, got a job, became more social, became very independent, no more cutting, positive, she BLOSSOMED. Phenomenal feat on her behalf. How far she has come and grown is astounding, to say the least. Last week I had the honor, the privilege to watch her graduate from basic training. Lots of happy tears. She has not seen her Dad in 3 years. Even though once they kicked him out and sent him back stateside, I drove her 5 hours to see him. She was 1 stop sign from his house, he refused to see her. I deliberately had an officer present so that he couldn't lie again and blame and accuse me something that I didn't do and never happened. I don't track their communication and dynamics. That's their relationship. I stay out of it. That's the best thing for me. He was extremely abusive and controlling in several forms. The only way I found to navigate it is to say nothing because people would never believe how he REALLY is. Her counselor did warn me that abusers eventually use the same behaviors on their children. She explained just as my victimization was gradual and subtle, it will be the same for her. With that said, it was about 4 months after we moved that I noticed a pattern. Whenever she would go way back into her dark place or she was acting out, she had been in contact with him or something about him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week the day after her graduation, he out of the blue called me being condescending, rude, abrasive rant. I repeatedly remained pleasant but firm and did everything I could to get off of the phone with him. She was in the hotel room sitting on her bed, I didn't want to say anything or react in a negative way to ruin her day. I knew he was lashing out because wasn't there. That was 100% her call, decision who she invited for her ceremony. Keep in mind early last year he made a statement about ""some people would feel some kind of way because it's like they're choosing you over me."". I laughed at the notion because it isn't a competition. Each relationship is unique and shouldn't be compared. I knew then that the manipulation and pitting that was occurring in the house was yet again another form of his control and demand to be the ""good guy""/ center of attention. I wasn't crazy after all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, my daughter called crying from her training. She couldn't hear me so she texted. She said that he had contacted her and said that it was important. She stopped classes and told them it was a family emergency. Only for him to tell her that in a YEAR he's moving to the Philippines to live with his GF and her children. She said that she asked him would he be a Dad to her children. He told her he has to because he loves her and them. She was crushed. Her Dad has not seen her. Only calls to make everything about him. Out of anger because he was not at the ceremony decided to call her and announce that basically, she is replaceable.  Spite. This is NOT uncommon for him to do. Comparison, pitting, put downs, devaluing is one of his techniques. It always leads to you trying and trying to get his attention, love, support. He continues doing it over and over and over. You don't notice it, you blame yourself and he is really manipulating you with pain. Reminding you, "" I will get someone else if you don't..."". Now he's doing it to her. Even though this is supposed to be a YEAR away. He told her it was urgent. An emotional punch. Literally, abuse. 

   My heart is so heavy for my baby today. All she has been through. How hard she worked to pull herself out. Almost lost her to suicide. All of her hard work to find herself, her voice, and turn it around only for her Dad to unleash an emotional punch of punishment. He is an emotional sadist. I lived with it for decades. Took years for me to get out of the fog, get help and understand what I was experiencing. 

No one wants to be told that they're an abuser. No one wants to admit that they're abusive. Yes,s some do use it out of context. If you have been told that what you are doing is abusive, get help. Not for your mate but your children. Until you get help you will abuse those who you actually love, your children. Deal with whatever is causing you to be that way. Don't justify it. Get help. Seeing my daughter distraught, broken down, hurting after she worked her butt off despite it all leaves me speechless. No, abusers don't pick and chose. The behavior is displayed in every facet of their lives. Especially, if you are dealing with an abuser who work tiressly to ensure that they don't get caught.

"My husband has been meeting a family friend at her home or office and telling me he is at work.
It has happened about a dozen times that I know of over the last three months.

She is a person that we both have been offering emotional support for a very complicated family situation and current medical scare.

I want to believe that nothing inappropriate is happening, but there is no good reason I can think of that he wouldn‚Äôt just tell me where he was going.

Admittedly, I am not much of a detective, but I can‚Äôt find anything truly incriminating.
There are a few texts between them planning to meet, and I know that he has lied to me about where he was at that time.

In one of the texts she tells him to park discreetly ,‚Äùjust trying to avoid questions‚Äù and he agrees.

In another text he says ‚Äòwould love to see you for a little while‚Äù and she answers ‚Äúwould love the same‚Äù
(When this friend and I are planning lunches, we often say ‚Äòwould love to see you if you are free‚Äô so it is legitimately a phrase used innocently)
And during the time this has been going on this friend and I have been meeting for lunch every other week, she has been acting completely normal to me.

I just feel like if lines had been crossed I would see some proof of either intimacy or feeling guilty (seriously, this woman grew up with our children and has been like a family member for decades, we have so many friends in common - I really struggle to think of a more deep betrayal)

"Three weeks ago my wife told me that she didn‚Äôt want to be married to me anymore. She doesn‚Äôt think we‚Äôre good for each other and the depressive episode I've been in has gone on too long, and she just can‚Äôt take care of me anymore. She had been thinking about this for weeks but had finally made this decision - it was not a discussion. She'd already had her cries about it. I was completely blindsided and devastated. I booked a flight the next day to fly out to be with family out of state because she asked for space on her own.

We‚Äôve been together for 12 years, married for 5, and when we got together we were 16 years old in high school. I‚Äôve never known an adult life without her, we moved in together as soon as we could. We were best friends and though we each had our issues I always thought we balanced each other out and made a good team even if we were a little codependent. I am still in love with her and feel the same way I did when we were stupid teenagers who didn‚Äôt know anything else other than that we were crazy for each other and wanted to spend our lives together. A few years ago we even moved across the US away from all our family and friends to our dream city, just like we always talked about.

Now without her I am completely alone in this place. I've been in a dark place mentally for a long time and I can't blame her for wanting to see what else is out there. She's thriving and I'm stagnating. I just didn't think she'd give up on me. I took her for granted.

We don't have kids or a house or any of the things that make things really complicated. For better or for worse splitting up will be relatively simple and seamless to do. And after a 12 year relationship that's all I've ever known, it terrifies me to think that it will only be a few short weeks or months and then she'll just be gone.

When I left I thought there was a chance that we could work things out when I got back, but based on the brief conversations we‚Äôve had on the phone that seems unlikely. She‚Äôs so distant and formal when we speak, it breaks my heart. I was devastated all over again when I realized she's moving on, because I was still holding on to hope and all of a sudden that's gone too.

I fly back tomorrow. I‚Äôm really proud of myself for how I‚Äôve handled this time - I‚Äôve gotten back into good habits for hygiene, exercise and meditation, and even spent a huge amount of time researching and coming up with plans for how I can live on my own for the first time in my life and start off strong. Or as best as I can at least. I had to fucking force myself to do these things. I even had to force myself to eat, which I wasn't expecting to be a problem. But I did it. This was the kick in the ass I needed to escape the dark place I've been in.

The rational side of my brain tells me that I‚Äôm ready, that I can do this on my own even though it will be hard. That doesn‚Äôt change that the emotional side of me doesn‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt want to be without her and I don‚Äôt think what we have is unfixable. I miss her terribly, and every night I dream of us being happy only for it all to come crashing down when I wake up.

Tomorrow I‚Äôll have my first conversation with her in person since I left and even after so long deliberating I don‚Äôt know how to handle it. I want to show her that I can be the best version of myself. I want to tell her how disappointed I am that she didn‚Äôt communicate to me it was this bad for her before it was too late to fix it. I want to convince her to give me one more chance but I don‚Äôt want to beg. I want closure but I don‚Äôt want to close the door.

And some part of me also knows that she owes me no explanation at all. I‚Äôve read so many of your stories here over the last few weeks, a lot of them more similar to her point of view, and I can see now where she‚Äôs coming from and why she‚Äôs ready to walk away instead of attempting to fix something when her heart just isn‚Äôt in it anymore. Is it even kind or respectful of her choices for me to try to convince her to trust me again? Or should I just accept her decision with grace and move forward on my own?

I still don't know what I'm going to say. I have low expectations because I'm too afraid to get my hopes up again, and because I've worked so hard to prepare myself mentally to live on my own. But I still can't help but hope. I want to be the person she needs me to be. I love her so much.

Thank you for letting me vent. Reading the stories that people have shared in this community in the last few weeks has been one of the things that helped me the most. It's given me perspective and hope for what comes next.","Is it right to try to convince her to stay, or should I just let her go?",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce
"So my venue is all inclusive up to 100 people. It's a really amazing deal but if you go over that 100 person limit you are looking at $200/person which is wayyyy out of the realm of feasibility. Our photographer put in our contract that we have to feed them, which I totally understand. I'm wondering if it would be a hassle and looked down on to make a different plan for them for food? I don't have an issue feeding them but I'm not spending another $400 just to feed them and I really don't want to not invite 2 people I really love because I can't afford to feed my photographers. I don't really know what this other plan would be either. Maybe I could send someone to go pick them something up during cocktail hour? Would my caterer even allow that?

They also said they would prefer to have a seat at a table close to the sweetheart table so they can jump on any photographable moments and not miss anything. My thing is it would be pretty weird to serve them burgers from a fast food joint while at a table with people who are eating our catered meal. 

I'm also starting to think about feeding our other vendors as well. Is it normal to provide a meal for any other vendors?

"I know this is probably a ridiculous concern and I‚Äôm being a brat, but I can‚Äôt help myself. I got married in February, we are waiting for our professional photos to come back from our photographer, but for now we have a sneak peak gallery of about 60 photos. I absolutely adore them.

My mom has taken it upon herself to take her iPhone photos from the day and print them out and start handing them out to people‚Ä¶. I honestly feel like this is delusional behaviour. The photos are horrible. In half the photos my eyes are closed, the lighting is terrible. I have a mild lazy eye, so I am VERY particular about the way I‚Äôm photographed.

I just have no idea why they think their photos shot on an iPhone are better than our professional photos‚Ä¶ that we paid $4,000 for‚Ä¶ like they tried to give me a bunch of photos they took as a gift that they had printed?! And in half the photos they gave me my eyes are closed and obviously all the framing and lighting are horrible. Like I‚Äôm not sure how they can even see these photos and think they‚Äôre good‚Ä¶.

"Pretty much what the title says. Back on Thanksgiving, I was discussing the guest list for my wedding with my father. I let him know that it was going to be very limited due to the space. We are having the reception in my mother's yard. 

I let him know that I already had his family members, including family members of my stepmother, on the list and asked if there was anyone else. I asked specifically about his best friend. He told me that he would let me know as to whether or not to add Jeff to the list, and a few weeks later mentioned that the time of our wedding happens to coincide with sailing season and that Jeff would most likely be busy, so not to bother sending him an invitation.

I just got off the phone with my father, and he told me that when he had lunch with Jeff yesterday, he told him to circle my wedding date on his calendar! WTF!?! I explained to my dad that we can't just squeeze other chairs in there. There is a limited amount of space under the tent,  a limited number of tables that can fit, and only so many chairs that can fit around the tables.

I pointed out that my fiance and I had eliminated a number of people from our list that we really would have liked to have been there because of the limited capacity. I reminded him that we had discussed this already and how hurt I was that he went behind my back and unofficially provided a save-the-date to his buddy, even though we have not sent out any save-the-dates to anyone!

"So as time goes on I'm seeing more and more red flags that his mother is gonna end up being that kind of mother in law.
So during Covid she moved in with him because she couldn't afford her own rent but by June he should have his own apartment without her so I'm hoping her behavior changes because I'm not liking what I'm seeing from her. 
She is constantly mothering him or critiquing him down how to make boxed  Mac and cheese last night. I was sitting there like what?
She also acts like sometimes I'm a nuisance to her, a couple weeks ago we were tired after a busy day together and wanted to chill at the apartment. 
My guy texted her out of courtesy that I was coming over, she called him and went off him that she wasn't making dinner for us. We had just ate and had said nothing about dinner let alone her making it for us.
She also has a tendency to forget I'm there when I am and will talk to him directly about things.
Tonight topped the cake, we had plans to go out to dinner after I got off work and without even asking him, his mother orders delivery for them both.
Really pissed me off. This behavior is really making worried for our future wedding when we get into the the thick of planning, I don't need her trying to control it or whatever.

"We got tasting boxes yesterday from the two vendors we're almost certainly using: a place we've already put a deposit on for a wedding cake, and the only bakery I could find that does dairy free cake for the groom's cake. Everyone else is fine with them, but imo it's kind of a disaster.

The wedding cake was... acceptable, which I feel is a damning condemnation of something I'm spending over $1000 on and supposed to be excited about. The fillings are artificial gels that have never met a real fruit, the almond cake doesn't taste like almond at all, and the frosting was falling off the cake.

The groom's cake flavor was okay, but the texture was really off. Part of it might be that we apparently got a gluten free box for some reason...we absolutely should have turned around and asked about it the second we noticed, but the pick-up process was kind of stressful and we weren't thinking straight. That's on us. But I don't really like this cake, AND it means we don't get a chance to try what our actual cake will actually taste like, which is important to me.

We're staying with my parents for the weekend, so they got to try the cakes too, and they were satisfied. They were totally happy with the wedding cake (they didn't try the fillings). My mom, who is a chocoholic and one of the reasons we need chocolate cake, says she wouldn't be disappointed if we had the vegan chocolate cake (she liked the other bakery's chocolate better,but there's a dairy allergy we're accommodating, so vegan). My husband is perfectly happy with the cakes, and says my standards are just too high for cake.

Our wedding cake experience for the first, mini-wedding, was perfect. I'm so disappointed that the one that's 10 times as expensive is like 10 times WORSE instead of better.

We do have another tasting today, and there has been discussion of eating the deposit if we like this one better. There's also other flavors of cake that we didn't try from the tasting (I was already so upset, we put it away for later); I'm the one who loves almond, so if I'm already disappointed I guess we can do a different flavor if my husband prefers. We're not out of options yet, but I'm just so disappointed in my whole cake experience this wedding so far and wanted to vent.",Cake vent,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning

"Are there any other destination brides/grooms out there who oscillate between the alternate fears that only 10 people will come or that *too many** people will RSVP yes and blow out your venue capacity/budget?

I know it‚Äôs always a ‚Äúknow your crowd‚Äù sort of question. 

To give perspective on my situation, most of our guests will be friends between the ages of 30 and 45, well under half have children, and only about half work Monday through Friday (or have partners who work M-F). 

We are only inviting 5 family members, as my FH and I are both estranged from significant portions of our families and this celebration is meant to create a memories with our chosen families and loved ones. It is my sincere hope that guests only come if it sounds fun to them, and not out of obligation.

The wedding is set for Halloween of 2023, which falls on a Tuesday, in New Orleans. Most of us are on the West Coast.

The venue itself is 891 sq ft, though there is a bar taking up maybe 100ish square feet of that. There is also a balcony that extends over Bourbon St.

The venue is not typically used for formal seated dinners. It‚Äôs capacity is 100 for a ‚Äúlively cocktail affair‚Äù ‚Äî but the event venue manager has said they can fit about 40 seats at tables maximum, so 30-40 guests is what we are hoping for.

There is the tricky part. We want to invite about 60 people, including plus ones (and everyone is getting a plus one regardless of relationship status since it‚Äôs a destination wedding), with the knowledge that many will have to decline because of weekday/destination combination.

But all advice I have seen says to NEVER to invite past the capacity for your venue, and we want every guest to have a seat obviously.

Anyway, if you have read this far, I imagine that you are pretty deep into wedding logistics or perhaps have had a destination wedding with similar considerations. I‚Äôd love to hear thoughts about guest count considerations and predictions.

TL;DR: our venue can seat 40 guests, but it‚Äôs a weekday destination wedding in an expensive city on a holiday (NOLA, Halloween). Do we invite 60 guests knowing that many will decline, or invite just 40 and then send out more invites as we get declines?","Weekday Destination Wedding decline rate, is it ever safe to slightly over invite?",weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning

"We picked our venue and the person who we met and signed the contract with has left the company. We are about 8 months out now. We're left dealing with the GM, who we've only met over the phone where he seemed to have the emotional bandwith of Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh. The conversation was **extremely** painful with us trying to pry answers from him and getting very terse responses (where frankly, it sounded like he was half asleep). These questions involved pretty large sums of money, so we weren't nitpicking. 

Now, I'm familiar with working a lot of hours and getting too busy to respond to emails, but **very basic** questions are getting sent to his secretary and we are getting unhelpful responses over a week later. ""Can you provide the picture of the candle votives included in the package so we can show our florist?"" took **two** weeks. 

He can't seem to make time for phone calls, so this is the only way to do it. These questions also involve photography, which is holding up the ""free"" engagement shoot, which is holding up our save the dates, which is holding up our budgeting, you get the idea. Now, the venue calls me today and tells me they won't accept the next deposit on CC and that it has to be cash. I ask them if they can waive that so I can get the CC points and get a response **immediately** because there's a payment involved.

Now, I'm **really** starting to not like the guy because I'm finding his behavior unprofessional, but my fiance doesn't want me to confront him about it. My question is: Has anybody had an issue with their venue contact and found things got **better** as the date got closer? Any ideas what I can do here? We're already out almost $10K in deposits.

"I am getting ready to be separated after 6 years of marriage and together for almost 10. We still live together and she is moving out at the end of April but she told me she wants to separate at the end of January. There is no marriage counseling and we have both talked about divorce being our best option.   


Our biggest difference is that she wants to be able to go out to bars talk to other men, dance with them, essentially do everything except sex.  About a month ago she went out had drinks with another guy, danced with him, he escorted her to my car and she came home and told me how much she loves me. Then the following morning he texted her good morning beautiful and other sweet nothings. To me, it sounds like she is having an affair but when I confront her about it she said it means nothing and she just wants to be able to do whatever she wants with her being managed.

That story happened a month ago and I am still pissed about it. She said no dating while we are separated but that sure a sh\*t sounds like a date to me. I cannot comprehend how someone you've been with for 10 years is able to just go out and do that. She tells me I am a great husband, a great provider, have a great sense of humor, and I'm very good looking but my downfall is that I am a homebody and I don't want to go out. I'm just not a big going out person. 

What should I be doing? On one hand, I love her and I wish we could make it work but on the other hand, I just know there is nothing we can do to fix our relationship. We tried hanging out and we used to have a great time together when we would drink, this time around it was just short, cold and brunt conversation that really just ended with us not saying much to each other. The house is very quiet, she goes to the office a couple of times a week for work but when she's not here the house is very lonely and I honestly don't know if I should sell the house (we would possibly take a small loss) since we bought it only about a year ago. I want to keep the house since the house has appreciated significantly and she said she would help pay for a portion of it but on the other hand, I am alone in a 4 bedroom house and I spend most of my time in 2 rooms really. 

I just don't know what I should do. I struggle with how I should feel about everything. There are days where I feel okay but yesterday I just wanted to cry and be depressed. I simply cannot see a way in the future that things will be okay. I wish she isn't going to be a ghost I remember but I know eventually I will have to completely delete her from my life and that part hurts a lot.",I dont know how I should feel about my separation,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce
"My name is 'Kathleen'. I am a 44-year-old, divorced mother of two sons, aged 5 and 9. I am the product of a long-term marriage to a man who, at the end of his life, had a very devout religious belief that he should be buried in his own ""vestments of faith"".

&amp;#x200B;

My own?

&amp;#x200B;

How I put my life on hold for him and what little he allowed me to have.

&amp;#x200B;

My ex-husband, Adam, himself a highly successful businessman, had given me about as much freedom as anyone could imagine, given the fact he had ""important work commitments and very demanding leisure time"".

&amp;#x200B;

With little or no support from my own family, I had no real employment qualifications. Apart from the role I had taken on as a wife and mother. And yet, I never felt in Adam's view anything but very competent and worthy, and a valued ""wife and family member"".

&amp;#x200B;

So, even when I was experiencing some time after time, the same problems with my sons‚Ä¶the same interpersonal and inter-personal family and work issues‚Ä¶the same frustrations, I never felt I was lacking in anything, or foolhardy for not keeping my marriage alive.

I've always believed strongly in having a loving, supportive marriage, and, given my ex-husband's devotion to his beliefs, the heavy, demanding schedules he imposed upon his professional life, and the demands that his beliefs placed upon him, I always felt I was an extremely lucky woman, in all these matters.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, love can die‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

I know you were reading my mind, a short while ago and my last thoughts on all these matters.n when Adam asked me to commit to providing care, at the local hospice, for two very old, pious, and decrepit sisters, who were to be buried as one in their own 'private chapel' in an almost deserted church in the style of a 12th Century Church, I had little option but to say ""yes. I will help you in any way I can. Of course! I will help you in any way I can"".

&amp;#x200B;

Very early in the morning, Adam had driven me to the hospice.

&amp;#x200B;

He had already handed over to the nurses, the ""vestments of faith"" he had prepared, ready to have the sisters buried in them.

&amp;#x200B;

""Best we hurry now,"" he had said. ""Don't want to miss our train. Have to try and stay on schedule, in our plans for tomorrow. I've gone to considerable effort and expense for this, Kathleen.""

"Holy cow!!!! We did it! And despite some major hiccups, it was such an amazing time.

My biggest problem of the day was that my hair and makeup team who was going to come to the hotel room and who I did my trial with totally ghosted me the week before the wedding. This had me making a mad scramble that Thursday and Friday to find a replacement. Which I did via a Google search for salons close to the venue. And I had to go to them, but I‚Äôll be dammed if I didn‚Äôt have gorgeous hair and makeup for $150 total!!!! 

My biggest problem/regret was that I forgot a few important things. Since I got done at the salon, I still had to run home and bring my stuff to my hotel room at the venue where I got dressed and where the photographers were. It was a mad dash, and I ended up forgetting my veil and our invitation so we didn‚Äôt get that in with the traditional photo with my jewelry and bouquet. 

As I sit here typing this, I realize someone totally could have ran downstairs and checked if a guest brought the invitation with but hindsight is 20/20 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Once things got started and I was waiting to enter the ceremony, the DJ played the processional music and the minister, the groom and our parents all entered. Then he forgot to check if I was ready and just started playing my entrance. Then he stopped when he realized that I wasn‚Äôt there, but when the music stopped, the minister began the ceremony. I had to get my event coordinator to run in and stop him. 

He had some laughs about needing the bride here before they could start. The DJ replayed my song, I walked in and the ceremony went perfect from then on. So good video editing will fix that hiccup.

After that, everything was perfect. Amazing food and drinks and service. The room looked absolutely gorgeous. The music was great.

"I‚Äôve been on a soul searching trip these last 8 months, thinking back on our 30 years together.  I did not come out particularly well.  

Long story short: I feel I owe my ex some sincere unconditional apologies.  I know, she‚Äôs no angel either, there‚Äôs two in a marriage etc.,  but seriously.  I was out of line a couple of times.  Especially in hindsight.   Nothing shocking, or new to her.  No sudden secrets or upsets.  Just very specific moments where I was hurtful in a shitty way. 

Question is: would it help her in any way to find closure to hear these apologies, or would it just potentially upset her all over again?  Because that would be so futile. I think she‚Äôs on a pretty solid path to recovery, she‚Äôs a tough cookie, she doesn‚Äôt *need* my apologies.  But she may want to know I know.

I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúgain‚Äù anything doing this: we are still friends, and that‚Äôs worth a lot.  I do not want to upset that. 

It‚Äôs a bad idea though, no? It seems that, after the divorce is over and done, doing the right thing often means: doing nothing, despite the strong urge to say: ‚Äúsorry‚Äù.  Leaving things alone may be the kinder way.  Move on.  Let it go.  Or perhaps do it much later, when the situation allows?  I‚Äôm truly torn.

For example, we asked an acoustic guitarist to play at our ceremony; he requires only a chair and a microphone and our venue still needs him to provide proof of liability insurance for $1M with the company that oversees the venue listed on his policy. 

I also want to ask my friend to sing our first dance song. She's one of my bridesmaids but is also a professional singer (though doesn't perform at weddings). Will even she need this kind of insurance? What if she asks another guest to accompany her on guitar? If so does anyone have recommendations about where to get an affordable 1 day policy so she can sing?

"Hey all! I‚Äôm a MOH and I‚Äôm so torn on how to do expenses for alcohol before we go out to the bars. To start with, the bridal party is not very communicative for a variety of reasons. Once we go to the bars obviously everyone will pay for the own and the bride will be covered. However, before we go out we‚Äôre doing dinner and drinks at an Airbnb.

"I got separated in 2019, and officially divorced back in 2020. So a couple years have passed and did some casual dating after the separation which was a huge mistake since I was not emotionally available and had not healed from the divorce. 

Fast forward a to December 2021, met an amazing woman. My ex wife had initiated the divorce, so my self esteem and confidence took a huge hit. I did work on it some by exercising and eating healthy. She (my now ex GF)  was attracted to  me and all over me like no one ever has. Kissed on first date, sex by the third date, and within a relationship within 1 month. I have a couple terrible insecurities about myself  (physical )and she looked passed them. The daily texting, the phone calls, hanging out on weekends, going to new restaurants, exploring the city it all felt so great and like a relationship I wanted. One of the most depressing parts of the divorce was the loneliness. For the first time in 2 years I did not feel alone.

She ended things a few days ago saying the usual "" I thought I was ready for a relationship, but not in ready to be in one with anyone"" It only lasted 5 months, but wow I was really into her and miss her already. I thought about doing the whole begging and pleading thing, but learned that gets me no where since I did that with my ex wife right after the separation.  

FWIW she broke up with me 3 times in 5 months, but  she would always call me the next day and we got back together. I don't think that is happening this time. I thought going through the divorce would make me tougher, but no this still hurts a lot.

Between my parents, my sister, his parents- I want to just throw my hands up and let them run the show since everyone has so many opinions on these little details. I don‚Äôt have a wedding planner so I‚Äôve been managing this entire thing on my own and I wish my fianc√© would at least appreciate that.

When are you getting the marriage certificate?) as if I haven‚Äôt been planning this entire thing on my own for the past year. Which is fine- if i don‚Äôt plan my wedding who will, but please spare me the endless comments and questions. 

I‚Äôm tired of this being the only thing anyone even talks about anymore, it‚Äôs like no one has anything interesting going on so this is what they think about from the day‚Äôs start to end, and as a result I get bombarded with questions/concerns/opinions. I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôll snap over little things, my fianc√© and I argue over dumb things because this wedding is weighing me down mentally, and I can‚Äôt wait for the wedding to be done with.

I can‚Äôt believe there was a point in time I ever enjoyed this, I looked forward to it- and now I just want to roll my eyes so far back into my head they won‚Äôt come out anytime someone asks me a wedding question or shares their unsolicited opinions. To make it worse, I‚Äôm a people pleaser and I‚Äôm convinced being a people pleaser while planning a wedding is not for the faint of heart.

People will ask ‚Äúhow‚Äôs wedding planning going‚Äù and I might just cry the next time someone asks because how on earth is one person supposed to manage all this and have a full time career?

It feels like even if I try to take a break from wedding things, it‚Äôs still in the back of mind with my endless to do list, endless email to vendors, dealing with those unresponsive vendors.

"Hi all,
Longtime lurker, first time poster. I (28f) am 5 months into a one year mandatory separation before filing for divorce from my will-be ex (34m). We have a 3 year old son. 

We are very amicable for the sake of our son and have agreed on how we want to split things, etc. I guess my question is: Is it normal that I‚Äôm not broken up about the divorce? Of course, sometimes I have my moments as we were together for 8 years. But for the most part, I‚Äôm doing okay. I know that I grieved the relationship a long time before calling it so maybe that has something to do with it. 

Everyone has their opinion on how I should be feeling or how I should be grieving or living my life, etc - I‚Äôm sure you all know. That bothered me in the beginning but now I‚Äôm just doing my thing, focused on myself. I don‚Äôt even hate him - he is actually a wonderful father and a good person. I just don‚Äôt want to be married to him anymore (of course there are other things that went into this decision). 

I have had people who I thought were friends who assumed that I cheated and that‚Äôs what led me to this conclusion ‚Äúout of the blue.‚Äù (I want to clarify that I didn‚Äôt cheat.)

Anyways, I‚Äôm sort of rambling now but I was wondering if anyone else experienced this? A feeling of ‚Äúokay-ness,‚Äù freedom, and a bit of relief after separation? For all intents and purposes we are not together anymore, just biding our time until we can file. 

I still have my own healing to do- mostly surrounding myself and dissecting why I wanted to marry him in the first place. But all in all, I am okay. And society tells me that‚Äôs not normal. Anyone else?",Is this normal?,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce
"For quick context without getting it to the nitty gritty of the relationship:

It has been about 6 months since my ex left. She‚Äôs the one who wanted the divorce, and agreed to file. I wanted to work it out. We agreed to go to counseling. Come the day of, she left for her moms. The night before she stayed out all night at a bar with her friend and I am 99% she met someone. I haven‚Äôt seen her since. When she left I find out that the only bill she was paying at the time wasn‚Äôt actually being paid. It was 2 months behind. She was saving her money. She left me with back bills and the rent. She said at the time she‚Äôd pay me back. I said okay. She messages me once or twice a month, sometimes drunk and doesn‚Äôt remember talking to me. Whether she‚Äôs drunk or sober she always bring up the money she owe me and how she can‚Äôt pay me at that moment. I have never asked for the money at any point since she agreed to pay. At first it was the principle, but now I‚Äôm passed the point of caring about it. 
She usually takes this brief interaction to complain about how hard her life is going. It‚Äôs something different each time. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true, or she‚Äôs coming up with an excuse not to pay money she thinks I‚Äôm upset about. Or if she‚Äôs using the money thing as a reason to vent. At any rate she seems completely disinterested in my life, except for my cats. She‚Äôs gone so far as to say, ‚Äúif you ever get to a place where you can see me again, I‚Äôd really like to see the cats. I miss them.‚Äù In the same interaction, she indirectly asked for my address.

She has yet to file for a divorce.
I‚Äôm a little worried that she‚Äôll drag her feet for as long as it‚Äôs convenient for her to do so, until the marriage legally gets in the way.
I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm ready to absolve her of her debt to me, and use an online service to file myself. That way she has no real reason to contact me. Part of me is concerned that she might not be in a place to handle the added stress, but the other part of me doesn‚Äôt care.
I‚Äôd like to just be done with it. I don‚Äôt have any pressing reasons that would require me to be officially divorce, it‚Äôs just something I want. We can go our separate ways, and she can thrive or flounder without me.

Nevertheless, these past few years I‚Äôve received the much needed clarity that I cannot stay in the marriage any longer. I‚Äôve begged my husband to do simple things such as: asking about my day, helping around the house, not getting defensive when I bring up my feelings are hurt, being honest and communicative.

My fiance and I are getting married on May 28th, and are planning on have a semi-elopement style wedding. We are having the ceremony at the church, but are having just a few people there, and no reception.

"We originally booked our florist a year ago when we were thinking of doing a boho, greenery-heavy wedding. But over time, our vision changed to something a lot more modern and floral heavy. We tried working with them to see if they could execute our new vision, but just didn't feel very confident that it would turn out the way we wanted. We were basically asking them to do something completely different than their signature style.

It's not something I took lightly at all, and worrying about the florals was giving me a lot of anxiety. I literally scoured every single picture of florals they've ever done and couldn't find any that looked close to the style we wanted, so I made the tough decision to switch vendors. I just told our old florist and they're very disappointed and feel bad that they ""fell short"". They want to know who we went with instead.

I'm just not sure how to handle this situation, I feel like absolute trash, but if I'm going to pay thousands of dollars for florals I really need to feel confident that it's going to be what I want in the end.

"Pretext: My wife has been emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive for the better part of a decade. 

When I first tried to let her know I was unhappy with our relationship, she threatened to kill herself and our unborn son. Later, when I tried to tell her to start taking responsibility for some of the things she says (In this particular instance, she was pissed at her friends for not throwing her a birthday party, after she told everyone to cancel it last minute) she went, got a knife from the kitchen, and threatened to stab herself and our son in the womb if I didn't take what I said back. ""You will not tell me it's my fault."" was what she said, I got it on video...

As a result of this... instability, I reached out to various professionals, a lawyer, CPS, a DV specialist, etc and all of them had the same advice: don't do anything until I could ensure our son was safe. So thats what I did. I felt like shit for doing it, but I waited until she was in the hospital and our son was born to file for divorce and let her know. I also at the time filed for emergency custody of the kids and was granted it. The only thing I didn't manage to do was get a restraining order, because she successfully argued that such an order would prevent her from breastfeeding (She pumped for a week before giving up). So she is still in our house, causing hell. I'm probably over stubborn, but I don't want to take my kids from their home, their safe space, so I refuse to find somewhere else. 

Today, she went to some meeting, and afterward, texted me telling me I would have to take our daughter to a birthday party that she had been looking forward to. Irritating, but whatever, I love seeing our daughter happy. Halfway there, I get a call letting me know I'm not welcome at the party. Turns out she has been telling all our mutual friends that I am a monster that abandoned her in the hospital as our son was being born. (I've tried to keep our mutual friends as uninvolved in everything as possible; I didn't want to seem like I was trying to turn them against her.) So she had actually tried to send me to a party that I was entirely unwelcome to due to lies and half truths shes been telling our mutual friends. 

I'm rather pissed tbh. And now I feel like she's managed to isolate me even more than I already was. I don't know what to do beyond venting to Reddit.

"My husband said he wanted a divorce on 4/11/22. Here are the reasons why he wants a divorce:

\-I have had anxiety issues for several years and he feels like my anxiety has made his world small

\-He feels like he does not know who he is and what makes him happy

\-He needs time and space to find out who is he and what he needs and what will make him happy

My husband has also been under a lot of stress from August 2021 until February of 2022 because we sold a house and then bought and renovated a new house. During this time, he was spending some of each weekend renovating the new house (my dad is a professional contractor and did most of the work on the house). He is finishing up his grad school program and his thesis (which he has not started) is due in two weeks and his father is sick and has been sick since June of 2021. Since August of 2021, several times, sometimes in a joking way and sometimes in a serious way, he has said the following things multiple times:

\-he wants to dye his hair purple

\-wants to be called different names (like his middle name or a shortened version of his first name that he has never gone by)

\-he wants to find his identity outside of his job

\-he is constantly wanting to get new hair cuts or experiment with new facial hair

\-he is freaking out over turning 30 and having not accomplished anything

For the record, I am totally fine with him experimenting with how he looks and with him trying new hobbies not connected to what he does for a living. I do find the wanting to be called different names a little confusing.

My husband left our home on 4/11/22 (the day he said he wanted the divorce) and has been at his parents‚Äô house since. I did not want him to leave our home and told him he was welcome to stay.

On Monday, 4/11/22, he told me he did a free consultation with a lawyer but as far as I know, he has not filed for divorce and is not currently retaining an attorney.

We have been in marriage counseling since November of 2021 and have had a total of about 19 sessions.

We met with the marriage counselor on 4/11/22 (the day he said he wanted a divorce) and on Thursday 4/14/22. On Thursday, he said the following during the session:

\-he does not want to return to the marriage

\-divorce is what he wants right now

\-he needs time and space to figure himself out

In the parking lot after the session on Thursday, he hugged me and told me he loved me.

I do not want a divorce and I am very confused about what to do or what to think. We are meeting with the counselor again on Monday, 4/18/22.

I do not know what to say to him or to the counselor on Monday that will not push him further away from me. Does anyone have any advice for how to approach this next counseling session? Are there things that I should say or not say? I feel like my only ‚Äúsafe‚Äù option is to literally not speak a word during the session but I know that will not be an option because the counselor always asks each of us questions.

2nd argument: dating other people. I did bring it up prior and I thought I was ready but texted him that I wasn‚Äôt that I needed to work on myself. A few days later he brought it back up and I still wasn‚Äôt ready to see him date other people, I cried again. Wanted to reconcile. He got so upset and told me straight he didn‚Äôt want to be married, I asked him what he wanted and he said PEACE. (This was the most angriest I‚Äôve ever seen him before, while I plead and cried to work it out he kept saying no.) So I had to accept again that it was over. 

I just had to bring up the talk again about reconciliation, and I was calm, no tears, and he said he wasn‚Äôt opposed to it but, basically, I need goals or something to do or it‚Äôll never work. But he didn‚Äôt want to give me false hope by saying yes he wanted to reconcile. I know I need to better myself so whether we workout or not I can stand tall.

The day after, I know he immediately got onto multiple dating sites and reached out to some woman but haven‚Äôt met up with any of them yet. He did tell me that he has been thinking about divorce since 2018 because I changed after having our daughter. He keeps bringing up my slight postpartum depression that I had but it went away quickly. I also know he wants a deeper connection but he hasn‚Äôt tried to with me. It was always I that would bring up deep conversations. 

Thing is I‚Äôm a SAHM. No place to go with my daughter. He doesn‚Äôt make enough to move out himself. He‚Äôs hoping to get a big check and buy our daughter and I a house so at least he still cares right? But‚Ä¶we don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôll come. So I‚Äôm stuck. We still talk, it feels awkward sometimes. We keep kissing hello and goodbye in front of our daughter to keep it normal but also there have been goodbye kisses that weren‚Äôt in front of her. I‚Äôve been sleeping in my daughters room which she loves. I‚Äôve been doing my best to not bother him and let him be, to smile more, look my best. I still cook dinner for him and do his laundry and clean ‚Äúhis‚Äù house (he bought before we married but we were still dating at the time) Im hoping that the time I‚Äôm having to be here he would reconsider. Our marriage wasn‚Äôt too bad maybe dull and he is looking for excitement. 

I am speaking with a counselor to help sort my thoughts. I really just want to know if it‚Äôs a possibility to reconnect, any tips perhaps?  

You‚Äôre all probably thinking why I would want to be with him. I want our daughter to have a happy 2 parent household and because I love him. Maybe I‚Äôm trauma bonded too, but also it‚Äôs because I know he is a good guy, and now know he has his struggles too I always figured he was okay because he never brought it to my attention he‚Äôs always had a very stoic face. I don‚Äôt know what to do or think. S.O.S. I don‚Äôt know, what do you think?

"The divorce was finalized a few months ago. I want to move on so badly. I initiated but he filed. Neither of us really wanted it but...you know how it goes.  
I tried to move on. I still am trying. But I'm just stuck. Lost in a black hole of anger and regrets. He was my soulmate. I love him still, more than any human on this planet. And he moved on. There is no chance of ever reconciling and getting back the life I had with him. My house, gone. All of my friends and family, gone. My car, gone. The love of my life. Gone.  
The only thing we EVER fought about was his drinking. It wasn't bad at first, but the pressure of family life started to weigh him down. He started getting blackout drunk every night, coupled with the fact that he stayed away from his kids and me as much as he could. I have depression myself. I saw the signs. Binge drinking, basic hygiene out the window, isolating from us. Sure he'd socialize with his friends just fine still, but they wanted their drinking buddy to stay just as he was. I was alone with our three kids more and more and more.  
He didn't believe in depression, and I tried so hard to help him; to be supportive, telling him that IF he WAS depressed, it's okay, I love you and I want to help you. I put up with so much shitty behavior in the name of love. My mental health began to break, and I was falling into the same pit, I would drink with him and our friends from the time our kids went to bed to shortly before they got up. The bedroom had died months ago. I was so lonely.

Eventually, it turned violent. The man I loved so much had changed in the worst way. So I told him if he couldn't get help, if he didn't even want to try, I was going to want a divorce. And that's what happened. He made it as difficult and horrible and traumatic as possible, because he is extremely intelligent and knows me very well.  
I still am madly in love with this man. I know he no longer loves me back. He's in a new, serious relationship...so am I. And I hate his new girlfriend for taking what should have been mine, and WOULD HAVE been mine if my ex had gotten help.

I do love, but cannot fully love, the man I'm with now...even though he is very supportive and worships the ground I walk on. I can't help but compare the two and see my ex as superior. I've tried to end it several times because it's unfair to him that I can't give him my 100%, but he isn't going anywhere. He wants to get married. I'm terrified of it. At this point I'm pushing him away and waiting for him to end it. I KNOW I'm doing it but I can't warm up.

I'm mourning my past, present, and future. I know I need therapy to deal with this. But it's so hard to find the time right now.  
I think about shooting myself every day. It's like I can only see black and white, there is no color in the world. I hate my job, I hate my apartment, I hate my life, I hate myself.

"Our wedding is in October so I do have some time but I‚Äôm wondering what the proper etiquette is for something like this. Basically my fianc√©‚Äôs Dad wants to host a Stag Party for him that involves selling tickets to the event and then providing food and alcohol to those that attend. I‚Äôm not really involved in any part of that so I don‚Äôt have details further than that but the complications are that I‚Äôd really like to have a Jack and Jill party (a co-ed bridal shower for anyone that doesn‚Äôt know) because I really don‚Äôt like my fianc√©s family and I want him there for support overall. Also, I think it would be more fun with the men in my family there as well as our groomsmen. 

But I feel like asking the men of the wedding party to attend both a stag and the Jack and Jill party is a bit much assuming they will be spending money for both events. Alternatively I could just ask my fianc√© to attend a regular Bridal shower but that feels weird too. It‚Äôs totally out of the question to ask future FIL to cancel the Stag, as it was really dramatic just getting him to do this much as they did not want to contribute to the wedding in any way.

His family just makes me very uncomfortable because I know they don‚Äôt like me and therefore I don‚Äôt like them. I just wish I could not invite them but that would only make my fianc√©s life a living hell.

"One of the main reasons I am divorcing my wife is that her substance abuse problems that I was aware of were always digging a hole in our budget and no matter what, she'd make sure she could at least afford to have her substances even if it made bills late then I found out she was hiding an additional substance abuse from me for the 2nd time and this time for 5 months straight. I have been begging her for 2 years straight to let me help budget, let me help pay bills and it was always a ""don't worry about it honey, I got it"" followed by an ""Oh no, we don't have enough"". I was always paying more than my fair share out of the money we earned while she had all her creature comforts and I would neglect my own personal needs such as vision care.

In January alone,while I had lost my job at the end of December for reasons beyond my control and she was promising to help support us and pay the bills as she best she could , she had spent $560 at the smoke shop alone and would rather still blame all of the late bills on me not having a job. Which yes, that made it alot harder but theoretically she could've paid rent that month or at least some of other bills so we wouldn't be playing as much catch up. We only got caught up in a sense by the end of February and only because I got my old job back and like usual, I was paying over half the share in order to get it done. 

 We were already on a seperation of sorts back in December after increased toxic erratic behaviors on her part over the past 5 months (which made alot more sense upon the additional substance issue discovery). I had messaged our uncle at the time of separation to discuss it with him and he hadn't gotten free time until last month. I ended up having a phone call with him in which I told her I wanted it to be private, I was going to be discussing the separation and she agreed. Then she eavesdropped on the conversation because ""she felt insecure"" and she blew up over only pieces of the conversation she overheard. At this point, it was the straw that broke the camel's back because she's never really respected my boundaries in the first place, so I said yup, I want a divorce now. 

My past month has been a hell of dealing a wishy washy still substance abusing ex over a divorce I was still trying to make my mind up on but had to just dive head first and I was offered help and a place to stay until I can get another place. I had all my things moved by the first of this month but had I been taken off the lease at the old place, she would've been disqualified and lost the apt immediately (we were already on a month to month). So I offered to stay on the lease for this month, help pay the bills still and she should be looking for a roommate. 

Well, here I am, trying to talk to her about proper bill paying schedules and she's trying to tell me we should delay our phone bill so she won't have to ask me for more money in rent but then we will have a late fee on the phone bill anyways and pay more. I know we could pay both bills this week but nope, she doesn't want to do it that way. She also hasn't even begun to clean the apt up even,  making every excuse in the book as to why she couldn't find a roommate. 3 weeks left of March and I know she'll be asking me for help in April. I feel like it's all a game just to beg me to come back because she can't possibly financially support herself and if I were to come back, I'd never be able to save up to leave.",Im trying to help my ex financially since the divorce has just begun but she seems to want to keep self sabotaging and still not wanting to actually work with me on budgeting appropriately.,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"On Tuesday night I told my husband that we should get a divorce. He texted his ex girlfriend asking her to start a life and a family with him and that he loves me but will never be entirely happy with me. This happened eight months ago. 

He claimed it was a mistake and I attempted to reconcile since it was two months prior to our wedding ceremony (already had been married a year and a half). Everything was swept under the rug, but he had been doing his best to be a good husband. About a month ago everything hit me like a bus and I've been absolutely broken up and devastated.

"Background: me (early 50s, F) married in early 20s to husband (late 50s, M) for almost 30 years, two kids soon to be empty nesters. Relationship started as friends. I had had partners but only one long ""relationship"" and that was in high school. He, being older, had multiple long term relationships in his 20s. I was fairly messed up sexually when we started dating. He gave me my first orgasm and I thought that was the climax (no pun intended :) of sexual success. He has never given positive verbal¬†feedback to me about my ""skills"" or appearance - he says the¬†fact that he keeps wanting more after all these years should be enough. For many years I think this validated some of the self hate I had that stemmed from trauma in my teen years.¬†

We are completely opposite in the way we think and communicate - I am introverted,¬†measured and analytical - he is extroverted, action oriented and impulsive. For the most part, we are quite¬†aligned in how we like to spend our free time (we like to travel to the same¬†countries, have a wonderful group of friends, enjoy holidays/events with family, and value time for fitness). He finds me intelligent, witty and fun and a good host/party planner. I was attracted to his humor and work ethic. He's very well read and knows a ton about some more niche subjects that I am interested in. We have pretty compatible taste in terms of design, art and culture. I think we have a healthy balance of mutual and individual interests.¬†

In my 40s I went through some intense and painful therapy to work through my issues from my childhood. It was incredibly difficult but I am a better person for it all around (less angry, less anxious and more loving - it also started a sexual awakening that made me comfortable with my own desires and sexuality). My husband is in many ways happy with this change but it's opened my eyes to the things in our relationship that simply are not ok. He wants intimacy his way and won't entertain discussing some things I would like (these desires are quite benign). There is part of me that thinks he liked the old me that just followed his lead physically.¬†

I'm not totally sure how to describe this but he is detached emotionally. Everything is always fine, no problem is ever real. Communication is light hearted and teasing ALL the time. Our physical interaction is the same way. During the pandemic I discovered that he has been hiding some very deep issues from me for the entirety of our relationship (part of this is a kink that he has that he won't allow me to indulge him in - I suspect he is addicted to porn). I used to think he didn't have a depth of feeling now I believe he hates himself and hides it with humor. This permeates every aspect of our relationship. He promised to get help (and have pleaded for the two of us to get counseling together) but I've been waiting nearly two years with no action. He refuses marriage counseling saying it will just be sessions reminding him of what an awful person he is.¬†

I like my life. I like where we live, our children, our friends, our social activities and the financial¬†comfort I have.

"So we are going to hire a couple of responsible high school aged kids to be our DD's.  Basically one person to drive the guests car to their hotel and the other to drive a vehicle to pick up the other DD.

Wondering if anyone has any idea what we should pay them? I thought maybe $50/each but I guess it also depends on how much the price of gas is at the time.

I'm thinking they will come around 10PM and potentially work until 2AM(at the very latest)

As far as driving goes it'll be a 10KM radius basically so not driving super far from venue.

"I know I‚Äôve posted on here a couple times already, sorry I‚Äôm being annoying, but I need to vent as I have no one else to talk to. No living family left, no friends, no one!

Wive decides she doesn‚Äôt want to me married anymore, and the ugly papers were served. As much as I don‚Äôt want to be with someone who no longer loves me, I know think about how dark the future looks. 

To cope with this horrible process called divorce, I‚Äôve been living like a hermit. I go to work, I come straight home. On weekends I make it a goal to leave the city (I‚Äôm in nyc) every single weekend, because I‚Äôm an introvert who couldn‚Äôt stand people even before marriage, and now it‚Äôs gotten way worse. Whether that‚Äôs road trips to local cabins, or flights somewhere, I make it a goal to never be home. Plus with covid and all the new variants popping up every couple months, I‚Äôm scared to socialize anyway. I‚Äôm vaccinated and boosted and had covid in December anyway, and nearly died. 

I think I can be happy being a hermit the rest of my life, as long as I can continue to travel the world, pursue my hobbies and make enough money to survive. Those things make me really happy, and I don‚Äôt feel I need any friendships (hard to make friends at 35 years old anyway) or relationships with woman to make me happy anymore. One day I just want to leave the US entirely, get a remote job, and travel the world constantly like a nomad.","Divorce destroyed my life, now I want to live in isolation like a hermit",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"The divorce wrapped up last May after years of back and forth. What we learned to call ""the cycle"" as we tried to make it work, separate, make it work again. We cycled several times since 2017.

In 2020 we gave it a final stand, we moved to her home state during the pandemic thinking with the support of family *maybe* it would be the missing piece. I thought she was going to die from drunk driving she became so miserable and self-loathing. 

She still says I was unhappy during that time, but I tend to disagree. It felt really good to me being around her family and having that pressure taken off whenever we needed help with our son. I started vaping D8 to cope with her and my own shit, which helped. 

One Friday night she came home saturated in Tequila. I watched her sit on the toilet, throwing up and crying at the same time and thought ""am I going to watch this person die in her 30s from alcohol?"" because she is literally so broken that having everything people dream of was not enough for her. Because all she wanted was to chase random men, which I was fine with, its a weird time I get it, but then she couldn't even absolve her own guilt to make that work. So I said goodbye to our combined income, very cushy life nestled amongst family, and gave her the fucking divorce.


I guess I thought, probably while high, that this person is just destined to destroy herself and has no intention of ever even trying to be content or happy because what she mistakes for happiness is chasing pleasure. Chasing pleasure is never enough. 


I still don't know if I did the right thing with the divorce. We moved into the same apartment complex to make it easier to co-parent while we transitioned, we are on friendly terms and she is still slowly destroying herself. We still hooked up for a while, which ended a few months back and now it feels like its finally over.


I know I have some PTSD from all of this, I still battle depression weekly. I try to imagine what the next phase of my life looks like and I just draw a blank. In some ways this entire thing woke me up I guess? And now the normal things we say to each other to get over divorce ""work on self, go to the gym, join an activity group"" just does not seem to work, it feels like alternate delusion. 

I am slowly turning to Buddhism to try and let everything go because I honestly don't know if I can just tuck this away, date randoms until I find a match, and just go on like nothing happened. It feels like I am waiting for something, but I don't know what. Or maybe its the fear of it all happening again.

"Hi good people of Reddit, 

I haven‚Äôt posted in a while but after a cousin told me I was wrong I don‚Äôt know anymore I‚Äôm second guessing myself with what happened and I want to hear others opinions. Not that it matters the marriage is over for sure lol but just so I learn from my mistake and not do it again. What else can I do at this point? 

So my ex wife moved into my house when we were dating. I come from a very cautious family who always advices me to protect myself. I was more then happy to have her live with me. However, before she came and live with me I went to the lawyer and protected my house just in case. Common law or married doesn‚Äôt matter I wanted to protect myself. I didn‚Äôt want to tell her I went to the lawyer but I wanted to be honest so I did lol she was furious at the time. She would say things like you don‚Äôt trust me Etc. I tried to explain my side but she didn‚Äôt care. At the time that should have been a red flag but I didn‚Äôt see it. Another red flag was she once told me her dad would never let her date me unless I owned a place lol  a big reason I did this was her parents. They were very weird and unloving, they used people and very money hungry. They used her a lot for money. They were in debt also and my biggest biggest fear was that they would convince her to leave me and take half my money and yes they were capable of going that. 

Anyways Eventually she calmed down and she acknowledged it and was ok. We got married eventually. Now the house is very small and we needed a bigger one for a family. I made it very clear I wanted to protect the money I was going to use for the downpayment 600 k for at least 3-4 years  I wanted to make sure our marriage was going well before she got half. The last thing I wanted was for her to walk away in a few months and take half. That happened to a coworker I know. after 3-4 years if she walked away or something happens I can live with losing half lol pre marriage she agreed but post marriage she changed her mind. She was trying to manipulate me to try and get my protection null and void. When that didn‚Äôt work she left me ran to her parents and they lectured me I should trust her. Then she gave me an ultimatum and threaten divorce. I tried my very very best to talk to her but nothing worked she just kept insulting me, said I‚Äôm not a man, and more horrible things I rather not write like my brothers going to die soon (he has health problems) 
She picked up her stuff a day later moved out went to her parents. I continued to work it out and she refused. Her condition was I had to buy a place on my own no protection.  I was so weak at the time I agreed all I asked in return was she come back and live with me and help me look for the place. She said she never wanted to go back to my house.  She wanted a new place and I had to find it,  After 2 weeks she got fed up and blocked me lol 
I found out months later she had a job offer in another city the same time this was happening. It almost felt like she had nothing to lose either I did what she wanted or she‚Äôs moving on new city new job and that‚Äôs exactly ages I did.  Found out she was on a dating site a month later also, 

This is a brief summary lol so why am I on Reddit? I was at peace with what happened. But my distant cousin found out what happened and said I was wrong. She said My ex wife felt like a maid Because she cooked and cleaned and did deserved half the house. For context yes she did work full time and did all the cooking cause I hate cooking. I would work, take out trash clean also laundry etc take her everywhere because she didn‚Äôt drive and to make up for cooking I did all the dishes lol and pick up take out and do grocery shopping so maid was a bit of a stretch.

"Been doing super well since stbxw filed for divorce 3 months ago. 3 months left. First month was horrible, second was semi horrible, and third had a ton of growth, but still hard. 

She moved on a month after separation (possibly even sooner, who knows) and started dating her ex from high school. Dude has no job, and one of our biggest issues were spending time with each other. Well I didn't know she wanted to pay the rent!

I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm really excited for this summer. I've been working out and lost around 22 pounds, and by summer time I'm gonna be looking really good, and I think I'll be ready to date. I've also been going to therapy twice a week, and it's helped me tremendously. 

The hardest part in all this, is being worried I'll never find someone to connect with like I did with my stbxw, but you know, I may find someone I connect even better with. 

I gave it my all, but at the end of the day, if someone doesn't want to work on a marriage they simply don't love you as much as you thought they did. We share a kid together and he's already sleeping over every night at her parents. (They both live with their parents, super classy, really going back to those high school days) even had my daughter cry to me because she used to sleep with mommy, but now she has to sleep in her own bed and mommy locks her door. And that was rough to hear. I also saw ovulation test strips that she used when we got pregnant, which makes me think they are trying to get pregnant, and honestly, I'm just like wow lol. No job, living with your parents, she has a minimum wage job, and can't even be there for your other child most of the time right now.

"My husband (38) and I (39) have been married for 7 years, we don‚Äôt own a home or have children. This is my 2nd marriage so this is hard but I don‚Äôt know what else I‚Äôm supposed to do, I need a partner!

The rest of this will be important for later‚Ä¶.He has a nerve disease called CRPS, it truly is awful and I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone. When we first got together I was under the impression he would be receiving settlement payments because the cause of his disease is from an injury he sustained at work (hit by a bulldozer) so I didn‚Äôt mind he currently didn‚Äôt have a job and was living with him parents (he was 28 at the time and had been in the hospital for about 9 months only about 2 months prior to us starting to date). Right before he asked me to marry him (after dating for about 4 months &amp; living with me for 3 of those) he received some settlement money, $139K. He paid off roughly 10k in debt that I had (the only debt I had) and I have no idea where the test went because at the time it was not my business. He then proceeded to run up roughly 50k in debt in my name saying he would just pay it off again with the next payment. In the 1.5 years we were together before we got married we have had sex once a week or so, at least 2x a month even if he was hurting from the CRPS.

Since we have been married starting on the night of our wedding, we‚Äôve had sex 7 times total in 7 years (not once a year either there was a 3 year span of nothing) and when I say we haven‚Äôt had sex, I mean no intimacy at all, nothing besides pecks on the lips, hugs and some very light cuddling where I put my feet on his feet. When we have had sex he has always been completely intoxicated. I recently begged him to please schedule a urologist visit, he got blue pills, they work but he doesn‚Äôt take them or worse he takes them then doesn‚Äôt act upon the urge. If I try to make a move he‚Äôll push me away. I thought it was because I had gained a little weight so I lost a bunch of weight and am now probably thinner than when we first met, still nothing. At this point when something does happen it‚Äôs so awkward for me because he‚Äôs so drunk and I‚Äôm not and I‚Äôm not attracted to him in those moments but I also don‚Äôt want to reject him so I just let it happen. 

He has never received another settlement payment, if I ask he says he doesn‚Äôt want to deal with his lawyers. He currently works a job that pays very little but it is his profession of choice. He makes roughly 17K a year, and I make more than 5.5x that currently. A few years ago we were struggling with making ends meet and I would cry and pled that I needed his help and he would say ‚Äúone day I‚Äôll make more money‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok if a bill is late, at least we are alive‚Äù so I decided in my head at that time that if I was the only one that was going to be stressed about money, than ‚Äúl‚Äù would do something about it, so I got 2 additional jobs on top of the full time job I already had (not sure how I convinced myself that was ok but I did) I am and have always been the one that takes care of everything, money, bills, house, food, cars, repairs, he will help with chores though. For the most part we get along great, he‚Äôs not mean to me but if I try to bring up responsibilities or sex of any kind then he just shuts down, his disease is to blame for everything (as long as it‚Äôs not something he wants to do like play golf or stream playing video games). I am not the type of person to argue or just bitch, if I ask and you don‚Äôt answer or you just shut down over and over again I‚Äôll just go about my business on my own. 

I tired of doing it on my own though, the only way I can get him to react about the sex part is if I get upset and tell him I feel like the mom and not the wife, and for a week or so he‚Äôll pat me on the ass while I‚Äôm in the kitchen and then that‚Äôs the end of that! I recently had a conversation with him about following through when I do ask him for something small like picking me up from the airport (it‚Äôs a 9 min drive) I told him it made me upset when he asks me to Uber home when he is home. I recently got back from travel and before I had left I asked if he would pick me up because I was getting in late and he said sure no problem. When I was on the way home he informed me he was sick and would not be coming to pick me up so I needed to
Uber at 1am. That was literally the last straw, I don‚Äôt ask for help, I do everything and I don‚Äôt bitch and it was too much for him to drive the 4.5 miles to get me, even though he was awake and watching TV when I got home.  

I contacted a lawyer today via email because I need to know my options, I am also going to talk with a therapist. Likely I will pull him into a therapy session with me to tell him because he is not going to take it well. He regularly in casual conversation says stuff like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd kill my self if something happened to you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live without you‚Äù to which I have always been very stern in saying that is not healthy and does not make me feel good and he shouldn‚Äôt say things like that! I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs doing it to be manipulative but it is in its own way because now I am actually worried he will unalive himself if I tell him I want a divorce! To complicate things our lease is up next month so I need to get this going and give our landlord at least a 60 day notice but I am worried about where he will go, he can‚Äôt afford to live in our house on his own.","I can‚Äôt do this anymore, it‚Äôs like a have a large child instead of a husband.",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

I am at my wits end with my husband and just don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs time to throw in the towel. We‚Äôve been together for almost 15 years, married for almost 13. 

My husband was fired from his job (dept manager at local grocery store)  in August. I have been the breadwinner for the past 6 years, working full time as an RN. At first I was optimistic about his job search ‚Äî everywhere seemed to be hiring and offering sign on bonuses. It‚Äôs been six months and he hasn‚Äôt even had a single interview. He has applied to 68 jobs since August. That‚Äôs like maybe 3 a week. 

Most days he sleeps in until 1030-11am, will clean up (bare minimum) around the house for an hour and then will spend the rest of the day playing video games and smoking weed.

His unemployment ran out last month. He didn‚Äôt tell me. I am barely making by with bills and put my foot down earlier this week that he has to get a job..any fucking job. He‚Äôs applied for our local Amazon warehouse and if everything goes OK he should start mid-March. 
So the past few weeks have been incredibly stressful. Bills are piling up, my car needs a $1500 repair, and we owe $2500 in taxes. He just doesn‚Äôt seem to give a shit. I understand he is depressed about his situation. He does have a psychiatrist, who he reached out to immediately when he lost his job, and has been on medication for anxiety/depression for years. 

One of my issues is that I feel like he spends so much emotional energy worrying about his friends and their lives that he doesn‚Äôt check in on how I‚Äôm doing or feeling. I always feel like the bottom of his priorities. 

His best friend (Sean) is an unemployed alcoholic. Prior to my husband‚Äôs unemployment he would always comment on how Sean needs to get a job and stop drinking. I understand wanting the best for your friends but this was a constant issue for him ‚Äî it really seems to bother him. I try to remind him he can‚Äôt control what Sean does - if he‚Äôs going to drink/not work ‚Äî and it‚Äôs Sean‚Äôs life to worry about not his. I guess I view it harshly as I grew up with drug addicted parents and family members so I know you can only do so much. Last year I started going to therapy and was so hurt that SO never asked how things were going but would sit and spend hours complaining about Sean and his problems.  It makes me feel so unimportant to him. 

Earlier today we were driving and SO starts bringing up Sean and his issues. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to hear it and I don‚Äôt care about what is going on with him. SO got pissed and called me a ‚Äúraging cunt‚Äù. 

This is not the first time he has called me a name. 
He has never put his hands on me but 6 years ago we were in a disagreement in the car and he spit on me. 
I should have left then. 
As soon as the words left his mouth it reminded me of that time and all the other times he‚Äôs been verbally abusive. 


Once we arrived home I told him I was leaving to get some space. I told him I deserve better than how he treats me. He accuses me of cheating on him and treating him poorly. I have never cheated but he has multiple times. 

I work full-time and pay all the bills. I worked my ass off to buy us a home and two new cars. I cook (still do 75% of the cooking), clean, and have sex whenever he asks. Prior to his job loss a typical day for him would be to wake up around 830am, go to work until 3, come home and take a 2 hour nap, get up and play video games until 10pm when we would settle down and watch TV until I fall asleep. His only household responsibilities were to take out the garbage to the curb each week and cut the grass. And honestly this past summer I‚Äôm pretty sure he cut the grass maybe 3 times and I did it all the rest. Just writing this all down is so fucking eye opening. 


I just need the strength to leave this marriage. I met him when I was 19 (him 24) and we were married with a child within 3 years. I‚Äôve never had another relationship to compare this with but I know it‚Äôs not healthy. 

I just hope I can stick with my decision.

"Divorce became official last october and I have been doing really well. I've been a beast at the gym, been socializing, treating myself to nice things, feeling good and satisfied overall and even got a great new job. But with that new job, is relocation and here was the unexpected trouble.

After our separation and subsequent filing, I stashed away our pictures because I wasn't ready to get rid of them at the time. I eventually just forgot about them. But now, I am going through my stuff and stumbled on to our old pictures. I know I want to get rid of them with the move so my life in the new city can be truly a fresh start but it is surprising how difficult it is to get myself to go through with it.

"My STBXH, seemingly out of the blue, told me that he doesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with me anymore (end of Feb). This is not what I wanted and I wanted to work things out. He told me he is not willing to try and he is done. We went to one therapy session because I begged him and the therapist says there was no point in coming back if he didn‚Äôt want to try and work it out. I eventually accepted that the divorce was happening and didn‚Äôt fight signing the paperwork(end of March), but it hurts so bad. We have been married less than three years and we‚Äôre able to do a summary dissolution in CA.

We are still living together until I am able to move in the beginning of May and it is so hard. I have come to realize that my husband never respected me or valued me. He told me he wants a family and can never see me being a good mother. Through talking to him I have come to the conclusion that he has built resentment towards me over our entire relationship. Every time I needed support and he was sympathetic in the moment, he secretly harbored resentment over for years. I feel stupid that I still love him knowing that this is how he feels about me. He told me he did not value my opinions as much as his own because he felt he had so many responsibilities. He told me that the things that originally made him attracted to me eventually made him no longer attracted to me. 

I did everything he ever asked and I had no chance of ever being good enough. He has been so emotionless and systematic during this whole process, it is as if I never even mattered. 

I now know that divorce is the right decision, but I still love him. I‚Äôm so confused and I wish I could move sooner. I just want him to love me, but it‚Äôs never going to happen. How do I get through this? How should I act towards him at home? He acts like nothing is wrong and life is great. It is so upsetting to see him totally fine.

"It has been 6 months since we filed and we are living separated.  Given all of the lawyer, GAL, therapist, coparenting costs paired with my stbx's refusal to become gainfully employed (being supported by their enabling family, friends) and finally my inability to downsize our lifestyle thanks to the standing order, .... I went from perfect credit and no credit card debt to everything maxed out and unable to pay some bills.    


I'm a decently high income earner.  We still have the equity in our house and an average sized 401(k), but for the first time in a decade I feel strapped.  I'm about to turn 40 and I feel the next decade we is going to be me catching up.  Right before the divorce I proposed moving out of the city, reducing our lifestyle (and the stress), trying to retire early and quit the rat race, spend more time with our 3 kids as they enter their pre teen years.  Keeping up with the Joneses was getting to us (I'll admit it, she won't)  


My STBX expects a certain lifestyle that I never really wanted and don't want any more.  She feels she is entitled to it and now I'm on the hook for another 15 years.  


We aren't even to the half way point in the divorce since we are fighting over custody (hence the Getting Started flair)

"My husband ended our relationship because he doesn‚Äôt want kids. 
I have always wanted to foster and adopt and he knew that from within a couple months of us dating and was on the same page. 
Two years in to marriage he changed his mind, and has been very honest about it. He still doesn‚Äôt know if his mind could eventually change again but can‚Äôt deal with knowing how badly I want to be a parent and that he doesn‚Äôt think he will ever want that. It hurt really bad recently when he told me he will likely want kids in 6 or 7 years but will never want to foster and adopt. I would definitely be willing to have a kid biologically for him but would still want to foster or adopt. 
We both considered not being together after this all came out, but he is the one who pulled the plug 3 months ago and hasn‚Äôt looked back since. 
The problem is that our relationship was INCREDIBLE, I thought often that we were happier than most couples we have ever known (not that it‚Äôs a competition, but I just knew we were lucky). We had an incredible friendship, romance, sex, SO MUCH laughter, and treated each other like gold even in conflicts. 
I can‚Äôt decide: 
Is he being wise for ending things (I know I would eventually resent him if we stayed together and his mind never changed about kids)? 
Or is he a fucking idiot for throwing away such an incredible relationship and not giving it more time and thought? 
To be fair, he‚Äôs had anxiety about the kids thing for about a year and a half, and been in therapy during that whole time. It‚Äôs not like he hasn‚Äôt tried, but I definitely wanted us to fight harder before ending our marriage.

"Located in Illinois. To give some background info, STBX and I bought the home in August 2020 for $515,000. I provided $315,000 of my personal funds for the down payment. Currently, we owe $190,000 on the mortgage. 

Because of the current market and home upgrades I‚Äôd guess the home would sell about $600,000 in todays market (just a guess, not an appraisal). Home upgrades, roughly $15,000 were also paid with my personal funds. 

Ideally I‚Äôd like to stay in the home. He and I don‚Äôt have any children together and the home is our only shared interest. Cars and other accounts are held separately.

"My fianc√©e and I recently relented to make a wedding website after crunching numbers for our original plan to stick with paper invites, RSVPs, menus, detail cards, etc. We‚Äôll be sending a simple paper invite (one-sided) with a note to go to our wedding website for details and RSVPing.

We‚Äôre using Zola which has been incredibly easy. Our website is very, very simple with just a home screen, RSVP tab with meal selection and some FAQs about the venue, parking and dress code. We like it this way!

We do not want to make any kind of registry because not only do we not need anything in our home, we don‚Äôt have space for miscellaneous gifts. Furthermore, any money received would go to a fertility/sperm bank fund, which we are not being transparent about to all guests. There are many reasons for this but most importantly is not all attendees will know we are using donor sperm or need it (and that‚Äôs no one‚Äôs business).

Things like an itemized cash fund wouldn‚Äôt work for this reason. Common phrasing of any kind related to a honeymoon or housing fund would be disingenuous. I suggested something like ‚ÄúWe do not have a registry, your presence is the best gift of all!‚Äù but my fianc√©e and her mom didn‚Äôt want to explicitly dissuade people from gifting us with cash. A line like ‚Äúin lieu of traditional gifts, cash gifts would be graciously accepted‚Äù didn‚Äôt go over well with any of us.

So here we are, having only settled on simply not having a registry *or* addressing the lack of one on our website. I told my fianc√©e‚Äôs mom that she would likely receive the brunt of questions from fianc√©e‚Äôs family about this and that I wanted to help her avoid that situation, but she doesn‚Äôt seem to mind taking it on. My guests (mostly friends) likely all know there‚Äôs no registry and would be easy to talk to directly about it. We expect some old schoolers might just choose a physical gift anyway, and will of course accept it graciously!

But now I‚Äôm second-guessing. Should we say something on the FAQ that we haven‚Äôt already considered? Is it burdensome for guests who want to give a gift to uncover a dusty checkbook or remember to hit an ATM before the wedding? We do not want to make a back-up or small physical-gift registry at all.

"After 8 years of knowing him; 2 dating, 2 engaged and married for 4. I finally have built enough courage and resentment to ask him for a divorce. I consider us both, successful and ambitious individuals. We are both 29 have solid careers that pay well, no kids, just a mortgage. 

I told him 4 days ago that I want a Divorce. To be expected, he‚Äôs pretended like I haven‚Äôt said anything. He‚Äôs been busy helping his father who is Ill and working. I myself have also been helping my father-in-law and busy with work but still, I am not myself and can‚Äôt pretend all is okay. I can‚Äôt help but to resent him for pretending I haven‚Äôt said anything and for not being able to give this conversation the importance it deserves. In a way it reassures me that I have made the right decision. 

For those wondering how I got here; In short; we have a very toxic relationship. Always have, even before marriage. In the past he‚Äôs physically hurt me and overtime I reciprocated, which resulted in me breaking his nose. It hurts to write this. He‚Äôs been ‚Äúgood‚Äù the last two years making an effort to cope with his anger in a different way but he only stopped when I involved my poor mother. But things have never been the same, almost like once you lose respect in a relationship, there‚Äôs no way back.  
He‚Äôs a difficult person to communicate because he refuses to accept his wrong doing, apologies are out of character for him. He tends to do things out of spite, deflects blame, and is apathetic to how his choice of words or lack of action make me feel. He takes advantage of me financially, by making independent decisions that cost money and will ask me to pay half ALWAYS. If I question his decisions, it always results in arguing. I feel like I am a roomate and he‚Äôs a liability.  

Everyone loves him, they believe him to be kind, smart, the provider, and a giving husband. I just can‚Äôt keep up with the facade. I am tired of fighting and justifying  my emotions, my wants, and needs. 

Marriage is love, kindness, respect, and unity. You can‚Äôt have love without having the rest. I don‚Äôt have any of this. I can‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt know this before, because I did. The idea of that I could change him, by influencing his character, kept me going. Ultimately, he‚Äôs never changed and I‚Äôve compromised my character, values, goals, needs to make it work. 

Given what I know about him, what I have lived with him, and what his track record of decisions; I am prepared to lose everything I‚Äôve invested in this home. I am too tired to fight.   

I am scared, of the decision I have made. I am embarrassed of a failed marriage. I am concerned about what my future looks like, given that I am 29. I hate to have to start from nothing but I trust that I will be better anywhere else.

I'm thinking that I will offer/propose that for the first year or maybe 2 after the divorce, I will continue to pay the mortgage and utilities of our current house, along with some amount of alimony, so that my wife and kids can continue to live here and so we won't have to send the twins to daycare before they're at least a year old. I know that is something that neither of us want to do. Neither of us can afford the house on our own so after that period of time then we could sell it and do normal alimony, or whatever. This would also help lower daycare costs and I know it is something that would help ease the transition for my wife, if it's agreed upon.

"I'm not even sure where to begin this because my mind is whirling and I'm so upset at how something that was supposed to feel special went so incredibly wrong.

My wedding is in two months and my dress was purchased a year and a half ago. It's a beautiful dress, and I went to many different shops to find it. Note that I also did the majority of my shopping alone since it was during a huge Covid peak in my area. This is important only because it was a little bit lonely and disappointing, and I had hoped that things would only improve from there.

One of my good friends recommended a tailor to me. Apparently the woman was good at what she does, and did a great job with my friend's bridesmaid dress and her SIL's wedding dress. Sure. Perfect. I texted with the tailor a few times and set a date.

Cue today. I've been exercising, eating well and taking good care of myself. I'm also about five pounds heavier than I was when I ordered the dress. For reference, I'm 5'3"" and currently sitting at 128 pounds. I was probably around 123 when I ordered the dress and the bridal shop sized me at a 4. It is SLIGHTLY snug now and I attributed that to maybe some period weight and also lifting heavier weights.

I get to the tailor and it's in the back of a house. Okay, I can deal with that. People run successful home businesses all the time. She lets me in and instantly starts talking about her six year old daughter and how their Disney Land trips have been getting cancelled - okay, this is fine too, maybe she just wants to vent before getting the session started. She brings me into the 'fitting room' and the floor is covered in dust, scraps, pins etc... so the first five minutes is spent with her sweeping up the debris and literally not asking me a single question about myself, the wedding, or anything else that would make one think that I'm getting married. She leaves so that I can get dresses, and when she comes back in, the first thing she says is, ""OH no. You're going to need to lose at least five pounds before your wedding. There's nothing I can do."" I was taken aback but didn't say too much, then she elaborated that I should actually look at losing 10 pounds because there was NO way that the dress was going to look good because I ""had fat exploding out of the back of the dress.""

As somebody who has suffered with body dysmorphia since forever - this literally made my face go numb. She then made the following statements (unprompted, I might add):

* I need bigger breast cups because I have too small of breasts. Apparently I chose the wrong style of dress because there's not enough room in the bodice for push-up cups without which I won't look feminine.
* I wasted my money buying a Canadian-made dress because ""Canada's minimum wage is too high""
   * I bought this dress specifically because it's by a local designer and everything is made in our city. Especially during Covid, I wanted to make sure that my dress would be accessible and not stuck at the borders, and I love small businesses.
* I'm not to eat any fruits, sugars, breads until my wedding. No eating after 6:30 PM. No going to the gym. She said to eat as little as possible and to move as little as possible and to come back in **one month** after the \`10 pounds are gone.

Then, she tried to get me to follow her YouTube channel where she takes photos of weekly deals at Costco and sent my on my way.

I cried a bit on the way home and now I'm just sad. I still love my dress but the experience has me shattered... Fortunately I was finally able to get in touch with the tailor that the dress shop had recommended but whose email apparently had gotten lost in the mysterious web and she will be getting me in for an appointment in the coming weeks. I'm worried that this seamstress will say the same thing and that I'll always feel that my 'fat is exploding' out of a dress that I have been so excited to wear for the past year. I understand that there's only so much that can be done for a dress depending on how it is constructed and the amount of change necessary, but surely there is a sensitive way of approaching such things! Plus, losing ten pounds in 2 months can't possibly be healthy or advisable.

Has anybody else experienced this kind of interaction? I would love any kind of advice or support that you might have because I'm in a bridal spiral.

Photo for reference because why not and I still love it :')

"TL;DR My separated husband met a woman online a few weeks ago and is flying out to meet her next week. I'm a wreck and needed a place to share my story. This seemed like the right sub with people who might understand.

My husband and I have been together for three decades and living separately for the past few years (though in daily contact, mostly with a goal of reconciling and a dose of confusion thrown in). For a long time, we did things together IRL but after COVID we mainly talked by phone or text. We've not been dating other people during this time, and as far as I know that's true for both of us. 

Our relationship is complicated, which to me seems understandable after 30 years of history. We took a break from daily contact since the new year, because phones calls and texts weren't enough of a relationship for me and ended up making me sad. I said that I needed a little time to figure out what level of contact would work. Then in late January we had a logistical situation that needed our joint attention and we worked together well, which felt great. I was ready to discuss resuming daily contact and what that might mean.

But when I called him to talk about it, he told me he'd met someone online that week though he wasn't going to date her. He just thought he should tell me. A little while later, I found out he'd made flight arrangements to spend a weekend with her to see if they had something real or if it would continue to be an online thing. (He lied about it at first.) He said when he figured it out, he'd let me know if there was a status change into a long-distance girlfriend situation.

I'm a mess about it and he doesn't care. Over the past three weeks, we've talked a number of times and he's been either rage-filled, kind, open to talking, or testy. Now he seems mostly indifferent towards me. From what I've been able to gather, he closed the door on reconciliation a while ago.

I know that I can't change his mind or make him want to reconcile. And I feel like there's no way he'll choose me over a new person -- I come with all of our shared baggage, while a new person brings chemical attraction. Also, why would I want to reconcile when he has shown he's OK lying to me (not the first time) and clearly isn't interested?

His actions feel like betrayal to me, though I know some people might not see it that way, and I'm really struggling. My attachment stuff got turned to eleven when I first found out, though my nervous system has calmed down a bit now. I do have a therapist thankfully, but not a lot of other people to talk to about all of this.

We have a 5yo son together and agreed to 50/50 custody either the day of or the day after he moved out. He also agreed to continue to pay our son's school fees monthly (private prek) as well as come to my house M, W, F to pick him up and take him to school, and we would work together to share equal time throughout the week.

Since then his involvement has been slowly waning and while my son is okay with it--or at least doesn't seem to be concerned about it anymore--it is beyond irritating to me!

He has had zero overnights in the last 4 months, and only spends Thursdays (his day off) while I'm working and MAYBE every other Sunday for a few hours with our son. He hasn't even asked about him the last 2 Sundays at all, and I assume he's not planning on getting him this Sunday either because he posted about working 12-4 this Sunday.

Add to that I had to cover November school fees, 1/2 of January, and all of February and March. He didn't even bring it up to me the last 2 months.

I am so tired of being the bigger person and not complaining about the fact that he's been a shit dad to our son. It's so frustrating too because I make more money than he does, and when we go to court if we agree on 50/50 I'll have to pay him support because I make so much more than he does, and he's said himself he doesn't think our son will even want to stay the night at his house!! 

I love my son, and I don't mind that he's with me that frequently I think I'm just so angry at the fact that he has everyone in his life thinking he's super dad and he can barely even make time for our son at all. Even when he has our son where he's staying, it's really just to play with his roommates kids, not even to spend time with our child at all.

Meanwhile he has all the time in the world to meet new women and go out for dinner, to the bar etc. 

UGHHHHHH, I accept my own accountability for choosing him as a partner and having a child with him but he had me just as fooled as everyone else acting like he was great and everyone else was the problem. BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME ANY LESS ANGRY THAT HE GETS TO BE A PART TIME PARENT WHILE I AM FULL TIME NO DAYS OFF!!!

That's the end. I don't know if there's advice, coping ideas, or other people in the same situation or even people who've been there and found something that works for addressing the issue but I'll take whatever you got.

If nothing else, I do feel a little better getting it off of my chest.",50/50 custody but 3% effort on his part,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

I work full-time and do 80% of the parenting.  Pregnancy was hard, lost one of the triplets, bed rest.  She never left the bed.  Sleeps till 5pm every day watches tv at night.  Only spends 4-6 hours with us.  I work, do all errands, have to wake her up for any appointments, etc, etc. My day starts at 7am ends after midnight, usually spending an hour in her room watching TV and having dinner 10-11pm - and when ever I say I am tired its ""we don't talk, its a chore for you to spend 45 minutes with me!"" I have been sleeping in the other bedroom for years.  I am at end of my rope and do not want to live this way.  But she is so good at manipulating my feelings, like when I told her I was leaving.  Soon as that was real she said hey what about seeing a life coach? Give me a chance! I asked to see someone years ago, more than once since then.  Now I am thinking of exiting rudely, just leaving and telling the twins when I pick them up from school.  I actually had a bright spot met someone who I l was drawn too, but is unattainable (she's in a relationship).  But she became my muse for poetry.

"Found out yesterday that my mom presented my dad with some official divorce papers from her lawyer. Not too surpised but I'm going to play neutral Switzerland and help both get through this as that is the right thing to being their son.

&amp;#x200B;

Divorce will be happening in Illinois. Parents were married around 35 years and dad retired with a federal pension. Mom raised 2 kids and was a stay at home mom. After the kids were out mom never made an effort to get a full time job. Only source of income my mom has is an online business and some misc 1099 work which doesn't generate a ton of money but pays some bills of her own.

&amp;#x200B;

House is fully paid off and there is a car still being paid off that my mom uses primarily. My dad pays majority of everything through the pension income and credit cards. Home does have a small line of credit that my mom has been chipping away at since the line of credit was for her. 

I'm curious what this will look like for my mom and if anyone could provide some high level feedback it would be great. I'm sure my mom wants to stay in the home and dad will be looking for a place to rent. I'm assuming she will get some alimony but also have to come up with some sort of arrangement to pay my dad his share of the house? I'm not sure how she will pay the property taxes/car payment(if she keeps the car), among other things.

&amp;#x200B;

Just curious how the alimony is determined from similar circumstances if anyone has had or seen a similar case to this one here.

These are the sort of arguments where obscenities get shouted while my younger siblings are around (I‚Äôm the oldest) and I‚Äôm sick of it.  It‚Äôs been like this for years, and my mother has claimed she will file for divorce on multiple occasions but nothing ever happens.

"Long story short

husband (step father of my son) paid 400k as down payment on a house that ALL 3 of us are on a deed for.

we each own 1/3rd of the house. per any agreements/paperwork (escrow and deed).

my husband is seeking a divorce (verbally said it to my son) and im confused here.. he stated he wants to give me his part of this house mentioned (1/3rd) to live off of. He then said since he put money down as a downpayment, his equity holding despite 1/3rd ownership is more then mine or my sons. Therefore he thinks he will give me the 400k as a payment for divorce instead of his 1/3rd (which will be less).. with this occurring, i will not get any % of the sale and only receive the % as a divorce settlement.

This is confusing so please bare with me..

Can he do this? Should we sell the house prior to a divorce being filed so he cant use the money he claims he has right to (400k vs 1/3rd?).

would this benefit me? i feel if my son got 1/3rd (200k of 600k profit) and i got 200k (1/3rd again) and husband got 200k (1/3rd), i would end up with my correct share + any payments he owes me for a divorce settlement rather then the 400k (he'll try and settle during divorce) and no additional or little additional?",Divorce / real estate,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

My FMIL and FFIL had a bad divorce about 10 years ago. Since then she's been very hung up on the situation while he's moved on and has since happily remarried.

FH is worried about his mom feeling out of place being the only one from her family there.

Overall it was incredibly smooth terms of paperwork and  in front of the judge.  We didn't use lawyers so it was me walking her through all the paperwork and addendums needed.  I was afraid of some technicality holding everything up.  We were in and out in about an hour.   

I could feel myself on the verge of tears since I walked into the courthouse.

While waiting she sat next to me.  It was the closest we had been in months.   

When they judge was asking us both questions we both started crying throughout.   

As we walked out of the courthouse she pulled me in for a tight embrace and I squeezed her back.  She kissed me on my cheek and told me that she was sorry.  I told her that I was sorry too.   From there we walked away in opposite directions.   On my way to get back on the highway I would see her crying in her car.

Now I'm sitting at home at noon on a weekday drinking.   I made a drink for her too knowing she won't be here to drink it.   I don't know how I feel.

I texted my family and they said congratulations.   I don't feel like being congratulated.   I don't feel like this is an accomplishment.  I feel like this is something I survived.",Sock Day,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"So my aunt, B, has been dating the same guy, E, since I was a kid (I‚Äôm 28). For various reasons, no one else in our family likes him. I haven‚Äôt seen or spoken to him in about 8 years, and I only see B about 3 times a year.

Our wedding invitations went out recently and I live a few hours away from my hometown, so there‚Äôs hotel booking info included. My mom was speaking to B yesterday about how to book the hotel room for her and my grandma (her mom). B then says jokingly ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think [gma] and I are staying in the same room unless she wants to see E in his underwear.‚Äù

"Some backstory, I'm a 30M married to my 29F wife. We've been together since '09, married in '13 so almost half our life has been together. We have 2 young kids together as well. We didn't live together before marriage (big mistake), mainly because of her religious views, nor did we have sex before marriage (same reason). 

First couple years were good but then I started to feel controlled over what I could do and when I could do it. I'll admit this led to me not really putting forth as much effort as I could have as a husband. This in turn led to anger issues for her. She's a very vocal person when angry where I bottle most things in. We did have our good times and bad times. But I've always had to fight to have 1 night of the week to spend time playing videogames as my way to relax and unwind and to have a few house each Sunday during football season to watch broncos games. She took me needing my own personal time as me making these things priorities over her. I was always willing to move my game night if she wanted to do something on the one night I get, but she would never give me that time another night as a compromise. 

Well eventually her anger turned into full blown verbal and narcissistic abuse. Things that a spouse should never say to their SO no matter what. Even thru all this I still talked to her with respect, couldn't even hardly bring myself to raise my voice to her let alone say something hurtful intentionally. We talked about this several times with no change so we always fell back into old habits. 

Fast forward to last summer. She has her sister come over and talk to us as a ""role model"". The conversation started pretty fairly but by the end of it, everything was directed at everything being my fault. She left me with the ultimatum that if things didn't change she was going to divorce me (even tho she doesn't beleive in divorce cuz of her religion). So I took that as serious. I tried changing on my part but the abuse still continued from her. I ended up having a health scare last fall and almost died from stress plus a couple other factors. Really opened my eyes to I need to focus on my own health and happiness to be around for my kids. 

The last month or so things got to their lowest point. Every time she would hurt me it's like a piece of my heart was broken off. Eventually I felt a deep wound and sought out an emotional connection with someone. Ended up having an emotional affair which I know was absolutely the wrong thing to do and regret it every day. She found out and things were bad for a week. It ended up being a wake up call to her and now she's trying to do a 180 on her attitude towards me. 

The problem is I think I fell out of love with her after that talk with her sister. I don't feel a spark anymore when we hug or kiss or have sex. I think I severed my emotional ties to her. We are in counseling right now, but this counselor literally told me he sides with the wife most of the time and it's usually the men's fault. And pretty much justified her ABUSE towards me because I wasn't more attentive to her needs early on. Nothing has changed from the talks we've had recently nor these sessions. I've told her how I feel about losing the spark and potentially falling out of love.  She doesn't want to lose me and realizes how much she messed up and does love me. I honestly appreciate the effort she's going to now, but it's just not coming back. When do I know that's it's really gone for good and move on?

"Here's some context one of my bridesmaids chose a dress that shows a lot of cleavage, and she has really big boobs. None of the other bridesmaid dresses are even close to that revealing, except possibly my sister's, but she has tiny boobs.

 I originally thought the revealing dress was okay, but then I had second thoughts, my mom had second thoughts/strong opinions that it was too much cleavage, and then my hair and makeup artist (who I showed a pic of all my bridesmaids to so she could get a sense of everyone's hair) strongly encouraged me to say something.

So do you think this message is okay given the situation? The wedding is 7 weeks away and she usually has a big budget for alterations/this type of thing.

Hey (name)!

I‚Äôve thought about this a lot and please let me know your thoughts. After looking at all the bridesmaid dresses, I would really appreciate it if you could have some fabric added to the neckline of your dress so there‚Äôs not so much cleavage. I may ask my sister to do the same once I see her in her dress. I was having thoughts about it and then I showed my hair &amp; makeup artist a picture of the group so she could see everyone‚Äôs hair, and she strongly encouraged me to say something because of her past experiences with weddings. I‚Äôm also a little anxious about it because our wedding will probably end up being 75% family and 25% friends, so it‚Äôs really a family event, which is why my wedding dress doesn‚Äôt really show any cleavage.

"I'm asking for a friend... This really is not me.  It's actually my girlfriend who has the issue but I think she's afraid of doing anything.  The situation is this,  she pays her ex husband 21k a year for child support.  They have 2 kids together, ages 14 and 10.  When they got divorced she was making more than twice his salary so the courts awarded him child support money of 1800 a month (a ludicrous amount).  She also  pays for health insurance, half the extracurricular events and half clothing, haircuts, etc (though she rarely if ever asks for that). Did I also mention it's a split custody arrangement so they spend the exact same amount of time with mom and dad?  So far forward 2yrs from their divirce date.  He's sold the house she signed over to him for a profit of a couple hundred thousand.  He sold the house so he could move in with his girlfriend who is a surgeon... Dude falls up in terms of women who make good money.  He's got a huge house in an expensive area and recently my girlfriend found out he bought a brand new grand wagoner, which runs for about 85k st the least.  She is still giving him child as support as dictated by the divorce decree.  My question is if there's anything she can do about it.  He's not married this new woman but i clearly think that he doesn't need the 1800 a month, especially in a split custody situation.  My gf is worried about talking to a lawyer because she's also had a couple of promotions at her job and is making more now than she did when they got divorced.

"I chose a very simple, halter, satin ball gown (Collette by Rebecca Ingram) however I am rather busty and the chest basically revealed a *lot* more cleavage than I was interested in showing. I loved the dress otherwise and purchased it because the sales lady convinced me closing it was a super easy fix..

First fitting I found out we cannot close the cleavage because there is a seam up the midline of the dress and it would need to basically be deconstructed to close it and we would risk ruining it essentially. 

Then today at my second fitting, as she was trying to close up the back to make it flush with my skin.. she stops after a solid 15min of trying to pin the straps in the back and says (incredibly kindly and delicately) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, but the way the dress fits right now I don‚Äôt have enough fabric to work with to pull the back flush. You are beautiful, but the dress is just too small‚Äù 

Unfortunately it cannot be let out because it is sewn onto the boning alllll the way around the torso and there is no additional fabric because the only torso seam.. is in the front where the cleavage is. 

Finally, I requested a very low, sleek folded French bustle.. and that *also* can‚Äôt be done because there is no where to pin it underneath without adding something inside, but you would see the stitching on the satin. She said she could do it, but she would *highly* advise against it and go with an American bustle.

I really want someone to love and support, confide in and listen to and cuddle at night. I thrive on companionship.

One thing we were pretty set on from the get go was a no kids wedding - we both have little ones in our families but thought such a special, intimate and meaningful day in our lives should be kept child free.

Unfortunately, for several reasons, I'm not working right now and can't afford a place for myself while I wait for the divorce to be finalized (especially if it takes 6 months or more). But, mostly, it would be just too painful to be here completely alone, knowing my husband is here sharing love with his ex (his ex his married as well, btw, they're both liars and don't feel any type of guilt, so i guess they're meant for each other. I swear I don't know how they can do that to someone). I still love him so much that it hurts. At least in Europe I would have my family around and a change of scenery would help me to move on.

"Hi all, I have been here for a while. About 1.5y separated and I have 2 kids. 8 and 11yo.

It has been a struggle on many fronts for sure. We are still in the middle of the financial separation and the lawyers are involved. The trust bridge is destroyed but we still have to somehow work together so that we can be effective co-parents. I've been doing a lot of work to try to make the best of the situation and have been doing a pile of reading.

One book I recently read was Two Homes One Childhood by Robert E. Emery. This was by far the hardest book I ever read. It touched a nerve and made me confront many of my feelings about my kids and how they are impacted by the divorce. While it was painful to read it, it really helped me to get some perspective and allowed me to consider the long view instead of fighting the immediate battles to the death.

I strongly recommend it if you have kiddos you are trying to co-parent, espessially if your relationship with your ex is difficult. I recommend my ex reads it as well but even if they don't, I found it incredibly valuable.

Has anyone read this book? Does anyone have other book recommendations that could help to set up the kids in the best way possible post divorce?

"Hi everyone. I'm new to the world of jewelry (this is my first purchase) and would like some input on how to proceed with my situation. I purchased some very basic wedding bands for my FW and I at a local jeweler and they have been great. They resized each of our bands 2 times at no cost and offered free engravings. The problem is, we have since found 2 rings from another jeweler that we are *much* happier with for various reasons, and would like to return our purchase to the first jeweler. The rings are still in their original packaging and are unworn as our wedding date is later this year. Obviously, we feel bad about this because they've been so accommodating. To offset the pain on their end, we are happy to pay a restocking fee of about $300-400  or about 20% the total cost. We feel this is reasonable, because they can pocket that money, buff out the inscriptions, and keep the product to resell and hopefully still come out ahead. It seems this wouldn't be a totally uncommon scenario for them to deal with, although I understand it is an irritating one. 

So my question is: Is this a fair understanding of the situation? Am I being reasonable (albeit annoying) or am I putting the jeweler in an unfair predicament?

I have a hypothetical question about alimony. Is it for a certain number of years or a certain total dollar amount? A friend had a high paying job. He agreed to give his ex 40% of his income for 6 years. After 3.5 years he lost his job. His ex agreed to a temporary reduction until he is employed again. It‚Äôs been 5 months and he still doesn‚Äôt have a job. He is in a very specialized field. The last time he was unemployed it took him two years to find another job in this field. This happened while they were still married so she is fully aware how long it takes. He seems to think when he finds another job the clock will start again on the remaining time left. So theoretically he could be paying her for 7-8 years instead of the initial agreed upon 6 years. I think it should be 40% for the 6 years so at times like now when his earning is greatly reduced the alimony should be calculated off that not 40% of his highest earning years. How is this usually handled? His way is $4000 a month for 72 months no matter what he earns. My thinking is 40% of whatever he earns over the next 6 years after the divorce. I know he needs to consult an attorney and definitely will once he is employed again.

"I'm struggling with deciding who to ask to be a bridesmaid and whether to have a wedding party at all. I know my partner wants a wedding party, and it's very clear to him who would be included, but it's less clear for me. I have moved around so much in my adult life and formed close relationships at different times with people in different countries until inevitably, one of us would move away, and we didn't always keep in touch. I have a sense of like 10 people who I'm considering including, but I'm having trouble drawing the boundary, both for fear of making people feel excluded and because I just can't decide how close I feel to certain long-time friends these days. And don't even get me started on the complexities of inclusivity if I invite a cousin, SIL, or other family member to be a bridesmaid...

"I know many people here might scoff at all of this, and I know I can't control someone else. But I also know without question that my STBX is making a huge mistake, and there's nothing I can do to talk them out of it. We don't have compatibility issues on any level - mentally, emotionally, goals and desires for life, sexually, etc. None of it. There is no abuse in either direction. There is no infidelity. We have children we both love dearly. And the STBX says they still love me. And yet STBX is claiming this divorce is going to be better for the kids and for us? How can someone say that with a straight face when nothing heinous is going on in our relationship?

We've just simply been a little disconnected over the last couple years with twin babies that take a lot of effort and COVID and everything else in life. It's gotten crazy busy and life is different than it was before all the craziness, but how does someone just give up? Life also was getting better and easier every single day with pandemic stress easing and kids getting older and easier to manage. STBX is being goaded into it by someone they think is their ""best friend"", who has clearly never put their interests first. Hell, the supposed best friend isn't even a good source to take relationship advice from, when they themselves are on their second marriage to a second absolutely terrible human being. 

Again, I know nobody can be controlled. But literally every other person and family member in her circles, mine, or ours knows divorcing is a mistake. I don't know how to deal with that. I deep down know STBX will wake up eventually and realize this is all a mistake. But they're also too stubborn to ever admit that, and now our children will live with their own kind of pain and struggles their entire life. It doesn't make any sense and I'm struggling so bad.

"Yesterday, I celebrated my 46th birthday. To say that it was a bittersweet occasion for me is probably the understatement of this young year. I was in a warm bright house filled with my family-- eating delicious food, blowing out candles, and laughing at jokes-- but I was no longer wearing a wedding ring and sharing the day with my wife and stepson, unlike my previous five birthdays. It is very hard to describe how I feel.

I have so much for which to be thankful. My loved ones have been absolute rocks during the entire separation and divorce. They have let me vent my frustrations and shed my tears when I've needed it the past few months. Like many people, I don't typically like unsolicited advice, but this was obviously uncharted territory for me (for all of us) and I am trying to heed the wisdom I've been given. I feel a lot of resistance in my soul and heart and I am still so sad, but I know there is light somewhere ahead. If I know myself half as well as I think I do, my road seems like it will be a long one. I've accepted that. Even so, I try not to burden them too much with my troubles. The lion's share of the work has to be done by me alone, but I am grateful for the immediate support and love I have been provided. Although I don't ever wish my particular kind of trouble on any of my family members, they should know that I wouldn't hesitate to be there for them.

I experienced several flashes of rage and bitterness yesterday as well, despite my attempts to reasonably work through them. Many times I just gave in to those intense feelings; I'm pretty sure I cursed more on my birthday than all the other days of 2022 combined (not within earshot of anyone else; I spent a lot of the day by myself). Admittedly it initially felt great to release that hurt-- I felt justified in my anger, and while it isn't the healthiest way of expressing it, at least I wasn't holding it back. Anger is a familiar emotion for me, but I've learned from therapy that it usually masks underlying layers that cause it. I have been taught to go deeper into asking why I am angry and bitter, and many times it's because I regret so many things that I did or didn't do, and have issues accepting things as they are (and not as I think they should be). It's a huge bulk of the work I have to do and from where much of the resistance I mentioned earlier stems.

For better or for worse, a birthday is a milestone. Here's hoping I continue to walk a better path forward, however long it takes me.","Bittersweet. Right now, mostly bitter.",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"So long story short - we've been rocky for about 6 mo but very unstable the past 4 weeks. Recently, I've been finding I really need to share my  frustrations with someone  so I chose one of my best friends to open up to. She was very helpful in giving me advice and I trust her. After I got home, I texted her following day to let her know I had a convo w my husband --and went over EVERYTHING w him (dead bedroom, roommate situation, his lack of wanting to share finances w/me and how that creates a divide betw us, etc etc. She also suggested seeing a marriage counselor and gave me the name of one she went to years ago. I explained how our convo went over my text to her including how I brought up his gambling and lack of being open w finances and how Im not optimistic at this point even...but we will see, etc etc. SO, HE COMES DOWNSTAIRS a little while ago and said ""so you've told the outside about us"". I said what he said ""u said u haven't told anyone. WELL I checked your watch and read your texts and feel so betrayed and slandered"". I said - u should not be reading my watch, he said he thought it was our daughters - (she has same color band) but he knows it was mine). HE said he's mortified I said what i said. I told him I've been struggling and needs to get everything out to for my friend to listen. He said ""she will tell the world! I cant trust you -and I even woke up in middle of night last night and said to myself, I feel like Im being betrayed"".    OMG.  Im mad he did what  but cannot make him make ME feel guilty for confessing my concerns and frustrations to my best friend even IF it hurt him to read them. . I think calling it slandering is taking it a but far. And now im feeling like this is the beginning of the end.

"Love both Smith and Rock, some of their work is my favourite entertainment ever.

When I first learned what happened (through a non-related sub on reddit), I just lost all respect for Smith. Bigger guy uses violence against smaller guy over a tasteless joke, but the Oscars like many celebrity galas have turned into mini-roasts for years now. It's part of the gig being a movie star and comedians have said for worse without a violent outburst like that.

Then I saw all these 'August' jokes, which I had no clue about and made me curious to understand, so did some Google searches and quickly learned about his public marriage history. Then I saw Smith as a dumbass for a variation of the Streisand Affect. If a guy like me (that doesn't usually care about celebrity gossip) now knows about the embarrassing things about his marriage, then now millions of more people are learning about this which will surely lead to more people taunting him on red carpets to trigger him.

But then I started feeling sorry for him. This is a man who acted out irresponsibly because he is hurting, like big time hurting. I have no idea on the details of their marriage, maybe he cheated first and he can dish out but can't take it, so maybe he made his bed, but he is definitely the one hurting more in the relationship. Like the average joe guy who went crazy years ago and drove a tank through city streets due to problems in his marriage. 

And so I think there is a lesson here. No matter how bad your ex or STBX treats you, please control yourself. Don't do anything to get yourself in legal trouble, or do anything where your kids will disrespect you if they knew what you did, or do anything to jeopardize your custody percentage with the courts. Never resort to violence.","Made a double U-turn on Will Smith, good reminder to control oneself no matter how hard things get",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"Yesterday, I felt relief my husband left me 2 weeks before my last semester of nursing school. I did a simple task of cleaning the grout in the kitchen. I never realized it actually had a design. My husband expected me to clean 90% of the house because I was full time nursing student in an accelerated. I did my best with my chaotic schedule. On average I study 10-16 hours a day because having peoples lives in my hands has always terrified me, but I want to be the safest nurse out there. With the recent medication error case that occurred in March 2022, I'm even more vigilant on my studies.   


This week I am taking my board prep for my course and should be a happy time. However, I cannot help to think what could be and what could happen if my husband and I were together. We were married in 2018, so pandemic happened shortly after. I was working in another area of health care (waiting to get off a list for nursing school, finally applied to a different school and got in) and furloughed for a good portion of the beginning of pandemic. Nursing school is very competitive to get in and it was a mutual decision for me to go back to school to follow my life long goal of becoming a nurse. He grew up in a family of his mom constantly speaking down and saying they couldn't do XYZ. MIL was stuck in a job she hated and blamed it was because of her age and health that she couldn't get a different job.    


This past Friday my mom got placed in a nursing home. I am getting an IUD placed this week and my NP recommended IUD, because I have had severe cramps the last couple years (I'm pretty certain I have endometriosis but have never been diagnosed) . We were planning for kids after my first year of work for maternity leave which would have been in 2023-2024. I did inform my husband I was getting back on birth control for cramp relief, not to be sleeping around with other people (made it very well known for that). Mainly it shows up on the health insurance (I have to be on health insurance because I am a full time student).     


Just more disbelief my husband is behaving like this and still hasn't at minimum reached out to my dad to send a kind word to him. My dad practically prevented him from having to pay rent or mortgage (bought my house working in my first healthcare job when housing market wasn't crazy). My parents were together for 35 years and it wasn't an easy marriage at that (parents both lawyers). My dad has been showing up to the nursing home every couple of days (to allow my mom to adjust and him to get a routine).   


My dad is also struggling with the fact that his daughter was just left by her husband with no explanation. So I think a kind word from husband and in laws (in my state we are separated a year and a day). Just sort of stings because it feels like with me getting an IUD this week is putting an end to our dreams.

"I'm struggling and you all are in your own way but with so many similarities. I do feel like I'm alone. Not only physically but in my situation. I was truly happy, no toxic marriage, no blow up arguments, no dead bedroom, no financial issues, child or house work problems. No alcohol or substance abuse. No physical or verbal abuse.  I can say no infidelity in our MARRIAGE. I might have to add an astricks. I screwed up pre-marriage, I talked to a girl behind a screen for a month at work. I emotionally cheated 4 years ago, before we married. It was wrong, I screwed up. Physical or not, regardless of length of time or the fact that I came clean. I know I screwed up. I am a cheater. I don't know how, I let my guard down and made the biggest mistake of my life. I hurt the person that meant everything to me. Why? Because someone gave me attention? Because I had pain to deal with and that was my outlet? I don't know why. I keep searching but now 4 years later I just feel the guilt and don't even know what I was thinking. 

My wife told me she wasn't happy and left 4 months ago.  Why? Because she couldn't get over the pain I cause. I was blindsided, I had no idea she was holding all that pain in over the years. Not only do I have the guilt for what I did but now I look back and see what and jerk I was for how I dealt with it. I don't know why she came back. I don't know why she married me. I don't know why she never told me about the pain. I know we swept it under the rug, she tried to move forward and I forgot about it. She did not forget. She eventually resented me and lost all love until the only option was to leave. 

I am grateful she came back, I am grateful she married me and I'm grateful for the 7 years of happiness she gave me. 

I read all the bad stories of divorce and I don't know if I'm lucky or cursed. I went out on top, I lost it all but I had never been happier. The problem is many of you who had the toxic relationship have so much hate for your spouse that it sounds like it makes it easier to move on. Maybe that's just how it sounds. That is probably what my STBXW has for me. All along I'm stuck here, in pergatory, thinking about all the good times, feeling the rejection and guilt, trying to piece together the story so that it makes sense. All day long I try self talk. Telling myself to let her go find happiness, that I screwed up but I had 7 wonderful years. I tell myself ""she doesn't feel like you, you still love her and she doesn't, she will never love you again"". 

People say time will heal and you'll find someone else. I don't believe that, I wish I did, it would give me hope. It would give me something to look forward to. The light at the end of the tunnel. All I think about is that I will never see the woman I loved more than life again. This is my second divorce, I know what it feel to be in the throws of grief but this is more. 

Each of us has a unique situation but many with such common themes, I just haven't found tribe. Those of us who were truly happy. Those of us that lost it all with none of those common marital problems.

"Hello fellow divorcers/divorcees. I'm wondering what your life looks like being separated but not yet divorced. I'm asking for the divorce and my stbxh just moved out of the house about a month ago. Right now he basically stops in whenever he wants I've had to tell him via text like I'm not ready for you to come over yet when I need a little bit of Sunday morning time alone on slow mornings. But what's really getting to me right now is the fact that he has his own place but him being kind of irresponsible hasn't really put anything in it as far as furnishings or dishes or food so the kids aren't really able to go there yet. Nobody is really comfortable with it not just me! So he comes over visits with them a little bit but doesn't help out, doesn't offer to cook them dinner, or clean up after them, or offer to help with their laundry; a lot of the reasons that we are divorcing in the first place. He just sits there. Well his mother has been visiting for the last couple weeks from out of town and now they both come over by the time I get off at 5:00 they're sitting at my house and nobody has made a dinner plan and just wait for me to come home and do it. It's just getting really frustrating to a point where I'm getting more and more angry every day and I just want to be able to move on but I can't because they're always there.

I feel like my boundaries are being crossed but I still want him to see the kids. How do you all handle this? Am I being unreasonable to think that he should still help even though he doesn't live in the house anymore?",what does your family look like now ?,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,weddingplanning,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

My son is 7. He also has severe adhd  so he does get in trouble quite a bit. Me and his dad separated when he was 3 and after about 4 months he told me he wanted nothing to do with me or his son. I became a single parent. Suddenly about 4 months into quarantine he wanted to see his son again. He had gotten himself a actual sustainable job and has a decent apartment. I was married to this man for 7 years and knew who he was I wanted to make sure our son was in a safe environment so after about 3 months his dad had made a bedroom for him and I made sure he was sober and I let him start to see our son again. My ex had some drinking issue none that were ever abusive just lazy and could not keep a job he could never keep anything clean and that‚Äôs the main reason for the divorce. Turns out he is truly sober which is great for him. Anyways since I had a full time job and my son was always home I figured to have him stay with his dad for a day and a half so I could go to my office to get some work done without having to help him with school every 10 minutes. Since he has last had contact with his dad he had changed way different I had to let his dad know he had adhd and told him how to help him with school and things like that. His dad has never really been a parent so I knew he would have to get used to it. School at his dads did not really work out. My son had to much energy for my ex to handle. But I tried to have him stay but I wanted my son to go where he wanted. During distance my son would always jump on his bed and roll around on the floor play with his tech decks and look around his room but this was how he learned he had never been better in school before distance he was actually learning so I let him do this. I told his dad that he does this and he seemed fine with it but I was wrong. Whne my son started to do this In his room while in school his dad got so mad. He was told to sit still and concentrate but that is just not how he learns. After school his dad let him run around rev apartment complex unsupervised and when I called him to see how things were going I found this out. He told me our son had been out for about 1 hour and it terrified me. I told him to go look for him and he found him about 10 minutes later outside near the busy road. I don‚Äôt want my son in an unsafe situation but I want him to have his dad in his life. I asked my son if he wanted to stay and he said he wanted to try to sleep there. He did but kept waking up and his dad just told him to go back to sleep even though he was crying and screaming for me. He called me over and over on his iPad till it woke me up. He said he wanted to go home but I told him to wait till the morning. His dad then took the iPad and hung up. It scared me so I called him and he answered on his phone and said he took his iPad and he‚Äôs not getting it back till the morning. The next morning I told his dad in advance that I wanted him to take his medication cause we were doing something that required it. He did not and later I found out that he told our son that adhd is fake and he should stop acting out for attention. Later he was jumping on the couch so his dad yelled at him and locked him out of the apartment. I found him banging on the door when I came to pick him up. He was in his pjs and all the neighbors were mad that he was screaming at 8 am I would be mad to to. I banged on the door and he told me he was not listening so he punished him. I told my son to get his things so we could go. He does jot wanna go back he told me he is hurt for his dad telling him he is faking adhd. I want my son to have his dad in his life but only if he wants it as well. As of now his dad is trying to get full custody cause I am an ‚Äúunfit mother‚Äù but I won‚Äôt let that  happen. I don‚Äôt know if I am doing what is best for my son by keeping his dad away.

"I miss my family. I always resented how my mom (justifiably bitter from her own divorce) would caution me about blood being so important, all you can really count on. I never felt that way. I've always been in the, ""your family is the family you choose"" camp. It seemed like such a simple truth. For me it was a simple truth, for a really long time.

It's not simple anymore. He kind of ridiculed me recently, ""you still talking to internet strangers?"" He doesn't get it. How can he, he's seeing his family multiple times a week right now. Of course he is. He's leaning on them. He gets to stay on the other side of the wall that's now standing between me and what used to be my simple truth.

My own family, my blood relations, are practically strangers to me now. And a lot of that's on me, but a lot of it isn't. Either way, I don't know how to lean on strangers. I don't really want to lean on strangers (no offense, kind internet strangers). I miss the family whose name I still bear. Even if I'm not going to bear it for long.

I guess this is still just part of it. Still don't know how to lean on myself. Not really. Still looking to others. Still tripping over the cracks in my new life. Running into walls.

"My ex and I are technically ‚Äúdivorced‚Äù granted in court by a judge but still waiting to sign the final papers. We split in April of 2020 after 10 years together, 6 years married, 2 kids. 

That side of my life has been hell since then. Besides that I have been happy, my kids are healthy and I have met the love of my life that I finally feel like is good for myself and our family. 

Just last week, his girlfriend from hell (met her through prostitution, harassed me, threatened me, multiple felonies, had him arrested for domestic violence) called me. 

They were breaking up because he had done all of the same things to her. Mentally/emotionally/financially abused her, threatened her, put his hands on her (never put his hands on me). Though I‚Äôm not surprised. 

She then proceeds to tell me that he had been cheating on me for almost our entire relationship. (I was only suspicious but was never able to confirm). She sent me emails, videos, texts. He had been seeing prostitutes, sleeping with them before work, after work. Sometimes in my minivan. Going to glory holes to receive blowjobs from men. Anytime I would take our kids anywhere or I wasn‚Äôt home, supporting their drug addictions, even paying for one of them to get plastic surgery. 

At one point in our relationship I was battling with HPV that I couldn‚Äôt seem to get rid of until i finally left him. I confronted him many times and him being the pathological manipulative person he is always turned it back on me.

He was living a double life for 10 entire years. I am disgusted, heartbroken, sad. But this was all in the past and he is someone I will have to deal with for the next 15 years-life.

Now I'm coming to terms with all of the hidden abuse I was experiencing and trying to make sense of the monster he really is. I have been tirelessly working on  trying to get this divorce filed, getting benefits for my daughter, and getting a job. All the while my brain is the best torture device ever created. Thankfully the DV shelter helped me find therapy and stuff so I am getting that help but otherwise I feel like I'm drowning.

I find myself absent mindly starving myself and I've been getting compliments about the weight I've lost which makes me want to keep starving myself and I'm scared of these thoughts. I've never been scared to eat before. I find myself hating myself for believing in that man and starting a family with him. My therapist told me my defining moment wasn't loving or marrying him but leaving him when I found out what he was capable of.

My once calm and laid back husband started snapping and becoming so irrationally angry that I'm truly afraid of him. For the sake of transparency, he has never been remotely physically violent, so this is not a DV situation but it feels like emotional abuse. I feel like I don't know who he is anymore. I am not perfect and I have dropped the ball in areas of our marriage that I really need to work on, but I just don't think there is any justification for becoming so nasty, angry, screaming, putting me down, hurting me with his words. To top it off he has never been a very emotionally open person so even when he goes back to 'normal' he doesn't have a loving side to remind me of what there is to fight for in our relationship. I don't feel loved at all. I have lost all self respect. I hate myself. But I hate him more for doing this, for becoming someone else. He has made me feel so empty and worthless and I'm trying to claw my way out by separating from him.

I'm getting married in just under a year, so my fiance and I haven't mailed out any sort of invitations yet. We are getting married at a really great venue and have the space for 8.5 hours (4 hours set-up/get ready, 0.5 hour ceremony, 4 hour reception, and then a 30 minute grace period for cleaning up). It'll be a Friday night, so we plan on having the ceremony at 5:30pm and reception from 6 to 10pm. We plan on inviting around 150 (ish) people.

The venue offers an after party space with pool tables, ping pong, games, a cash bar, tables/lounge seating space, we are having our DJ set up karaoke because we are big karaoke people, and plan to order in our favorite pizza as a late night snack. The thing is that the after party space is really only big enough to hold around 60 people. I already know to count the 2 of us and 13 for our parents and siblings. We both have Greek life backgrounds and our friends can party for days on end, well past our midnight deadline. 

How do we go about inviting specific friends and not others to the after party? Or should we just let everyone know about it and whoever joins us continues to party with us and hope it doesn't get too crowded?

Hi all! I have been with my husband for a little over 7 years- no children. His whole family lives in town and my mom living in one town 2 hours north, and my father living in one town 2 hours east. Through the relationship we‚Äôve played with the idea of moving to a few different cities without really nailing one down, but traveled to multiple places to see where we‚Äôd like. I had begun mentioning it about 6 months ago that I was no longer sure about moving due to having much younger siblings (ages 10 and under) that would be very difficult to see grow up if we moved. I also have been struggling with mental health, and I know if I moved right now I would spiral without a support system (he works in a very busy field that requires long and unpredictable hours). I had mentioned that if he wanted to move if he could please consider somewhere within a few states so that it would still be possible to visit my family and friends easily. I‚Äôve also mentioned to him that I‚Äôm not feeling the happiest currently with our relationship (we have had issues with intimacy and emotional connection for a few years). I have suggested marriage counseling. 

I went to visit some friends in a different city over last weekend, and before I left he told me he had interviewed at a job (remote interview) across the country. I expressed, again, hesitation at this, because I didn‚Äôt even know he was applying for jobs yet. He had briefly mentioned thinking about it, but I had no clue he was applying yet. 

Well, he got a job offer a few days later. He told me over text while I was at work and I just felt so shattered. When I told him I was happy for him that he got a great opportunity, I wasn‚Äôt happy for myself due to we would have to uproot and leave here in the next 3 weeks and I‚Äôm still in a bit of shock about it all. He didn‚Äôt take it well and said I never told him I didn‚Äôt want to move anymore. He refuses to watch our dog whenever I want to go out of town (I try to see my family once every other month for a night, alternating. So out of town very infrequently), so I know if I move away it‚Äôs going to be a battle to ever come back and visit unless I‚Äôm paying for boarding while he‚Äôs actively just hanging out at home with the cats. 

He signed the offer letter a few days after this fight where I said I didn‚Äôt want to move, and told me I have a few weeks to decide if I‚Äôm moving or if we are getting divorced. He said if I plan to come with I can stay at our home another few months, but if I don‚Äôt plan on coming he wants to sell the house next month so I‚Äôd have to financially figure my life out by then. He makes double my income, so it would be a huge struggle to figure things out financially. The past few years he‚Äôs mentioned (jokingly?) what things he‚Äôd keep and which pets he‚Äôd take, and now I‚Äôm just kind of feeling very stuck on what to do.

"I am planning to file for divorce soon, most likely a diy divorce (no lawyers) because we have nothing to contest over. The only thing we share is a three year old child. My STBXH realizes that with his job and weird working hours he wont be able to do a 50-50 physical custody. He says he wont be able to give me a set schedule, which i understand given his career. He suggested he gets her 3 nights per week, but he also talks about working over time, going out on the weekends, and its like he wants to deliberately confuse me about the whole situation. He is obsessed with money and one of the first things he told me after we separated is that i will be paying him child support because I currently (slightly) make more than he does, we share the daycare fees and i pay for her insurance, so my fear is that he will take advantage of this ambiguous situation and get a 3 overnight on paper but not stick to it practically. We are now 50/50 according to our ‚Äúseparation agreement‚Äù but his parents babysit her when he needs them, and still she ends up with me 80% of the time.

"I‚Äôm getting married in July and I have 4 braidsmaids: my two sisters and my two closest friends. I want them to wear the same colour for their outfit but they can freely choose the dress.

I‚Äôm having a hard time choosing a colour theme for them and for the wedding in general, and in two weeks we are going to the venue to choose the decorations for the wedding. 

I told my bridesmaids this, and that I‚Äôll be able to choose a colour for them after this visit, as I hope I‚Äôll have everything more clear in my head.

Well, one of my sisters is being a pain in the ass, asking me almost every day for a month to pick a colour so she can buy a dress. I‚Äôve been telling her that I don‚Äôt know yet.

Well, today she texted me saying she bought a dress and I‚Äôm really mad about it. I told her that now she has two options now: buy another dress when I decide the colour or not being a bridesmaid. 

Am I being unreasonable?

"We were originally opting to serve beer and wine only at our wedding, since our venue allows us to provide our own and their staff will serve.  However, I've been back and forth with the idea of hiring a bartender so we can serve liquor... but I know that comes with an added price tag.  So I'm between a few options and would love your input!

1. Stick with a Beer &amp; Wine Open Bar
2. Hire bartender for Cocktail Hour, serve signature drinks and simple cocktails for hour, then switch to beer and wine
3. Hire bartender for entire wedding, serving beer, wine, and cocktails all night up until 9:30pm

Things to keep in mind - we're trying to save as much money on this wedding as we can, while also keeping everyone happy and appealing to the group.  We're inviting 35 guests.  Our group likes to drink, but I would say a good portion are beer drinkers, but I know everyone likes a nice cocktail at weddings...

"Long story short he left me stuck with everything for over a year. Didn‚Äôt start helping out until about 7 plus months in. We aren‚Äôt divorced yet. I wanted a clean break I don‚Äôt want to be friends as the betrayal is too deep. We had just moved a few years ago to a nice neighborhood with a few families with young kids. I became close with one family that live directly next store. I used to help with their kids and we used to hang out often. 

After he left I was devastated. I had also been dealing with his alcoholism and neglect. The neighbors expressed that they won‚Äôt take sides. Even though they know he did some very messed up things and continues to barely help me. One of the fathers even still hangs out with him on a regular basis. The wife has told me they don‚Äôt talk to each other about us because then this way we can confide in them and they wont be starting trouble. 

At one point I asked her why she would even want to be around him. And why her husband would be ok with what he did to me. She just said again they don‚Äôt want to take sides but agreed that he did some awful things to me. 

I‚Äôm hurt because I was planning on staying in this neighborhood but I feel spied on and unsupported. He does tend to snoop on me thru the neighbors husband. I have expressed to him that he should probably end the friendship. 

I guess I don‚Äôt understand why? Why would they want to be friends with him knowing things they know. I feel like I‚Äôm not important and that they support his decision and continued neglect.

"My (24m) wife (25f) is divorcing me. It is my fault, but it is still very painful. Things were genuinely great in our marriage, we rarely argued and never really had any heated fights or anything. 


A random flame from 7 years ago texted me out of the blue one night a few months ago. There were a couple days of benign conversation, and one time she called me while she was running errands just to talk. It was honestly the most boring phone call of my life. Things turned flirty the next couple nights over text.  I'm not sure if it was just boredom or horniness or what, but I flirted back a couple times. No explicit pictures or plans to meet up or anything like that. 


The combination of feeling awful about this along with simply not enjoying talking with the woman anymore (something was just... off) led to us not talking anymore. A couple months later, she saw me as a suggested friend on Facebook, and then she sent screenshots of our texts to my wife. In addition to the screenshots, she said that we basically had phone sex (not true), that we met on Tinder recently (not true), and that we had plans to meet up (not true). 


Of course, since she claimed this all happened over phone, there was no way for my wife to know what was true and what wasn't. If I had kept this from her for months, how could she trust me? The day after finding out my wife went back to her parents' home. A couple days later she came back to our city of residence, but she stayed with relatives for a couple weeks. 


She came over a couple weeks ago to let me know that she decided she wanted a divorce. She can't handle living the rest of her life wondering what else I might be hiding, and no amount of counseling or anything else could remedy this. 


I am distraught over this, but I understand her perspective completely. It just really fucking sucks and I'm very angry and confused with myself. Barring this awful mistake, I've been a wonderful husband. No abuse or manipulation, very accommodating, sweet with her family, understanding, very loving. This wasn't the endpoint of some decline in our relationship. 


She has completely shut me out now, and our only conversations are over text basically coordinating when we will alternate time with our dog and then legal stuff (sending over forms for divorce lawyer). 


Before this, I would've gone to the ends of the earth to destroy anyone who hurt my wife. She is the sweetest woman I know, and she gave herself to me completely and without question. Yet, I'm the one who hurt her, and I don't even have a good reason why except thinking with my dick. It makes me sick to think about and I am really struggling as this process plays out. I'm the bad guy and I hate myself for it. It was such a low bar. Just don't be unfaithful, and we will be together forever. I cannot believe I fucked it up so colossally and shattered the one person I love more than anyone else on the planet in the process. 


How do you try to deal with something like this and move forward? I know I need to go to therapy for stuff like this, but I really don't want to start that process of talking to a stranger in person, so I'd rather tell strangers on the internet first.",How do you cope when you're the one who hurt the person you promised to keep happy?,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

It was too late to sign a prenup, the wedding was literally in two days, I told him that we would change the legal ceremony into a civil ceremony and if things changed we‚Äôd get legally married a year later. Things did not change, they got worse. In addition to having to maneuver an addiction, I had to deal with lack of communication, lack of respect, and an ego that kept him from being honest about his feelings. Being married to him was impossible, he broke trust almost weekly and demanded that I care about his feelings while mine were ignored.

"Hi fellow dress shoppers!

"We are having a backyard wedding for 60 people and we will have just enough seating for all the guests.  We will have one 12 foot rectangular table to hold bride and groom and our wedding party and then three 16 foot long rectangular tables that will seat all the other guests.

Should we have a seating chart for the three 16 foot long tables since there is almost no extra seating?  (And by seating chart I mean assigning people to a table, not assigning their individual seats.)

Or will the fact that people might not be eating at the same time because of the food truck line naturally lend there to be some extra space and we will not need a seating chart?

"My husband cheated on me back in October. I've known him for over ten years, we were together for eight, and married for five. We have three beautiful children together. He was my best friend, my comfort, and he's all I've really known in my adult years. He threw away everything we had for a woman he barely knew. They had sex once.

" Hi I (19F) got into a marriage with my (20M) spouse we both live in California. Me and him found each other on tinder and he was an international student. A few months of dating he told me his parents ran out of money in Vietnam (because it was during peak Covid-19) to support him and his brother so they wanted him to go back to Vietnam. He wanted to stay and bring his brother back home and knowing how much my then boyfriend would struggle I agreed to marry him. I wanted him to have benefits as well as people have been talking about marrying for Fafsa money and other benefits too. I really loved him at the time and thought that the marriage was a huge risk I was willing to take because I really loved him so much. After the marriage everything was fine, the whole relationship was great until pandemic stopped and we both became busy with school and for him it was taking care of his brother. It was getting harder to contact him and I did not think much to it. Mind you we did live separately and got married behind my parents back. This eventually took a turn when he flat out ghosted me claiming his brother got Covid and needed him to be at the hospital. Then it was radio silence from there. No amount of calling or anything and after two months of trying to reach him I eventually cornered him down at his house to get an explanation but all I got was the same answers and how he rarely used his phone since he was so busy trying to work and pay off the hospital bills and take care of his brother. The only reason I believed him was because throughout our whole relationship he was the best bf and never lied to me. I have seen him take care of his brother and be so unbelievably tired that we would come over and sleep for days sometimes. I loved and trusted him that much and not to mention her helped me with so many things in the past and even gave me money when I needed it. After 2 more months went by, my hope was dwindling and I eventually finally found out that he blocked me and ghosted me fully and realized he did block my number this whole time. I was in shock because during the first month when he ghosted me I had called him everyday and his phone rang all the way through to voicemail, until eventually I assumed the phone died. I even tried calling it with my friends phone and it didn't work at that time either. I finally decided to call him on an unknown number and it went through and I called with my friends number and it went through. Then I realized that this relationship and marriage was over. He blocked me and wants nothing to do with me. I do not know what to do I initially wanted to get a divorce but I spoke to my law professor for some advice and he said I can get an annulment under fraud since my spouse had no intent to live with me, have kids, and pursue actual relations with me. I‚Äôm doing this alone with a husband I cannot contact. I don‚Äôt have money for an attorney and is desperate need of legal advice on how to do an annulment, what the process is for doing an annulment for fraud, what proof I need, and because me and my spouse have no shared assets, property, and kids, how long the whole process will take. I have a budget of 1000 dollars to help with filing fees and hoping that is all I have to pay if the annulment is uncontested. Please if anyone that is a attorney or lawyer, or has experience with my situation, can give any advice regarding what to do, where to start, and how to make this process as quick and cheap possible.

"My husband asked me for a divorce end of January. We were together 10 years, 5 years married, no children. 

His mother is dying of terminal cancer, this is known since December. I am in his family group chat (both their siblings+partners chat and their wider family chat). In the first chat there are regular updates about his mother and in the second there are regular family updates, well wishes for birthdays and so forth.

When he asked me for a divorce he said he wants everything to be amicable and I could be a close family friend. 

Since he said he wanted a divorce and to this moment I find a lot of comfort in that thought. I said yes, but only if everybody involved, including him, wants that as well. I asked him to inform me of his and the person hosting feelings about me coming to a party for example. A couple of those events have come up, but he leaves silently for them and doesn‚Äôt inform me. I do not mind not going, but I do mind wondering if I am welcome and not knowing a thing. When I asked him why he didn‚Äôt inform me afterwards, he said ‚Äúit was only for family.‚Äù The papers haven‚Äôt even been signed and I emotionally feel like I am still family. I hope(d) en was told they would feel the same.

I have been their sister/daughter for 10 years, since I was 16, and I feel more connected to them than to my own family. 

Now I hear from my stbxh that one of his sisters is privately asking him for me to leave the group chat. She says I am no longer family and that she feels weird about me reading personal family updates. I will leave if I am not wanted, but I feel so hurt that the ink is not even set and I am already being excluded. Especially considering this divorce is not my wish and I am still healing from being broken hearted. I would like to be informed and included in his mother sickness and oncoming death, because she was more of a mother to me than my own mother. His mother and I regular see eachother trough FaceTime (she calls) and talk about our feelings about this all. She dislikes her sons actions in not informing me.

I asked my stbxh how he responded to his sisters request. He said he didn‚Äôt say a thing, but when he showed me the messages he responded to her that he will talk to me about it. I asked him why he would lie about this to me, he said he lied because he doesn‚Äôt want any ‚Äúdrama‚Äù. I am hurt he doesn‚Äôt stand up for me and let some of his family members drive his actions. This was a theme in our relationship. I am hurt that the promise of being included as family appears to be false. I am hurt that (part of) his family regards me as no longer a family member, despite our 10 year history and the divorce not being my choice, when even the papers has not be signed yet. 

Should I leave the group chats now? What should I write in the chats in that case? Should I text my stbxsisterinlaw to leave us be and let us make our own decisions in time? Should I remain in the chats until my stbxmotherinlaw passes so I can read any updates?

What should I do?

As a bonus insult to injury: when my stbxh and I told everyone of our upcoming divorce, one of his brothers told my stbxh in privacy that he thinks that I left my husband now that I am able to be independent financially since I have gotten a job in September (recent University graduate). How can you think this about me and say this to poison my stbxh mind? I wasn‚Äôt even the one who wanted a divorce‚Ä¶ luckily my stbxh explained it was not the case to his brother, but how can you say and do things with no reasoning at all and potentially cause problems? I have been his sister for 10 years! He should have know better‚Ä¶

I am very insecure about his actions. We are European and married in a way that everything we own is split down the middle in a divorce. He wants more than his half and I said yes, hoping that it will make him happy. He is still trying to get more money out of me and feels I don‚Äôt give him enough (i offered him 
 4K more than his share). He for example wants me to split his larger debt and he wants to keep his larger retirement for himself. I am starting to feel like he doesn‚Äôt have the best intentions (anymore) regarding me, and I am still trying emotionally to recover and please him.

"Trying to organize a bachelorette and at a stalemate over lodging

Hoping to see if anyone has any ideas that‚Äôll make everyone happy, so I can approach this w a solution-oriented mindset and try to maintain positivity. 

Apologies in advance if this is convoluted because there‚Äôs 6 people involved. I hope you‚Äôre able to understand my dilemma. 

My friend (Dolly) is getting married soon, she‚Äôs wavered back and forth on having a bachelorette. She‚Äôs had to postpone her wedding twice, so we convinced her to do it, and will plan everything so it isn‚Äôt a headache for her. 

The girls are:
- Holly (Dolly‚Äôs sister)
- Clementine
- Blondie 
- Joan 

The girls and I had a call yesterday to discuss plans for Dolly‚Äôs bachelorette. We decided on a destination and booked flights, all good, then started talking about lodging. Blondie told us she wanted to be price conscious because she‚Äôs between jobs, she had to hang up early bc she‚Äôs coming down w a cold 

Joan, Clementine and I continued the convo about lodging. We discussed when we‚Äôd present the info to Holly and decided to wait until everything was planned so she wouldn‚Äôt have a chance to weigh in and potentially derail things. 

(Holly has a reputation for being very particular and difficult to travel with. It‚Äôs been speculated that she‚Äôs why Dolly kept flip flopping about having a bachelorette). 

Joan has connections to a hotel chain and found 2 adjoining rooms deal for $40pp for the whole weekend. Clementine and I got excited and told her to book it ASAP. Which she did and texted the group (minus Holly &amp; Dolly) once we were off the call. 

Blondie wasn‚Äôt impressed like we assumed. She wants some space to be able to decompress away from the group. She posted some AirBnb alternatives that are around $130pp if Holly goes or $200pp if she doesn‚Äôt. 

It seems to me that we need to find out if Holly is joining/contributing so we can make an informed decision. So I text Holly and invite her. She‚Äôs in, she can‚Äôt wait, and all she asks is if we can please stay at an AirBnb so she can have some space to herself to decompress. I haven‚Äôt told her about the hotel possibility yet. 

I relayed her request to the group. Joan is NOT happy. She has traveled w Holly in the past, she thinks this is step 1 of Holly derailing other plans like where to eat or what to do. She says Holly should rent her own room at full price if she wants space. I called Joan to try to smooth things over, she ripped into me for not sticking w the plan and telling Holly our plans. Fair enough. I own that. 

Joan has been taking the lead on planning and Clementine and I pushed her to call the hotel right away assuming everyone would be down. So I can understand that she‚Äôs frustrated and now wants nothing to do with planning. 

Clementine also wants to stay at the hotel as she‚Äôs very price conscious. 

My opinion is that I don‚Äôt give a shit. We‚Äôre all almost 40 and have full-time jobs except Blondie who‚Äôs between jobs atm, but seems more inclined to spend more for her comfort needs. If spending a little more will prevent meltdowns from Blondie and Holly later, then I‚Äôm happy to do that. But ultimately, I just want to pick something and be done w it. 

Joan is of the mind that it‚Äôs a 3-day trip, we should go w the hotel and that Holly and Blondie need to ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù. She thinks Holly had her chance to plan things and didn‚Äôt, so she needs to be flexible. I tried to reassure her that she doesn‚Äôt even know about the options yet and isn‚Äôt being difficult (yet) tho I can‚Äôt promise she won‚Äôt later. Joan has butted heads with Blondie on their last couple of trips, so I think she‚Äôs also on edge over that, too. 

So Joan &amp; Clementine want to stay at the hotel for cheap. 

Blondie &amp; Holly want to spend more for an AirBnb. 

Dolly is none the wiser. 

This is where we‚Äôre at. 

I was thinking a compromise could be that we stay at the hotel and I opt to get a 3rd room as like a cool down space for anyone who needs a break. I just don‚Äôt want to be financially responsible for the whole bill ($400 for the weekend as Joan‚Äôs discounts only cover 2 rooms max). So maybe I‚Äôd offer to cover it if anyone else is down to pitch in and see what they say? 

I want to start a new group chat that includes Holly and catch her up on the options while (hopefully) avoiding conflict. 

And I think it‚Äôd be preferable for Dolly if we were all staying at a single place together, so I‚Äôd really like to think of something that makes everyone happy in doing so.

"Maybe it's because I moved through the grief process relatively quick (there was a rock bottom like most everyone that was miserable)?  By the time we filed our decision to divorce was mutual.  


Maybe it's because I was easily able to reorient my northstar to focus on 1) the kids and 2) loving myself?   


Maybe it's because I have no desire to date or be intimate with anyone even though I'm the best I've looked since my early 20s (39M)? Nothing 15 minutes, the 5 knucle shuffle and a good imagination can't take care of once a week.  I have found companionship in my friends and family.    


Maybe people who get divorced and hang out in divorce groups are ""damage goods"" and giving off that vibe with how/what they communicate?  People who are able to get divorced and have a healthy approach to it don't spend all day in divorce subs and facebook groups.  


IDK what it is but I find divorce support groups rather miserable and often toxic with bad, baised advice.  This honestly does not come from a place of judgement - do what you need to move through the grief process and move on with your life.  But when I read most of the stories and advice in places like this I get a cringe type feeling when I try to relate it to my personal situation.  I empathize with them but the negativity and misery I can take less and less as I get further away from our filing date.  


(Backstory) I'm still living separated since July as we fight over custody. Everyone say ""that must be miserable.""  My stbx can't stand it as she says she can't live in ""peace"" even though she is prolonging everything with bogus filings and delays. At this point I could see this lasting til next winter, if not another year. As the breadwinner WFH male she assumed I should have just left as she was the SAHM.  But she wants to get back in the work force and needs to go into an office, I don't.  She wants me to pay for aftercare and daycare, but I refuse.  I didn't need it growing up and my kids have never had it.  She could get a WFH job give her experience before being a SAHM but refuses as she can't work around the kids.

It has gotten to the point where her passive aggressive triggers don't work with me, and since I have taken away that power from her narcissistic self is pisses her off even more.  She is coming unhinged and lashing out, and I just calmly and continually call her our on her lies and procrastination while still thanking her when she actually follows through on her commitments.

I know I'm not normal but right now I don't give a fuck how long this takes.  However long it takes to get the best outcome for the kids is what matters.",Is anyone else turned off by the people in divorce community and groups?,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"I have been down this rabbit hole before.

I am a 27M and I have been married to my 28F wife for 6 years. We have no kids but I know she wants to have kids one day. We were both U.S. Military at one point, but I got out and am now a civilian and she is still military. That sums up our miscellaneous background information. 

I have contemplated divorce many times over the years due to a rocky start to our marriage where we were geographically separated and she threatened me with divorce almost every other day. I was young and definitely not blameless. I could have and should have been more attentive to her and spent more time talking with her and showing her what she meant to me, but I didn‚Äôt. Hindsight and all that. Following that, we were reunited but the threats continued and accusations of me being selfish and unloving were commonplace. I didn‚Äôt do these things for gratitude or leverage, but I was the reason why she has a Master‚Äôs Degree and even why she has an Army career to this date as I have made sure that when she over drinks that I have been there to get her back to her domicile. I 100% know that I am a very supportive and loving husband, and she has even admitted that she only says these things to hurt me. I am the farthest thing from perfect. I have made mistakes that cost me my career and futures prospects several times over. She chose to stand by me through these times which I am grateful for, but, for the reasons mentioned above, I secretly wish she would have left me but I did not initiate this myself since I didn‚Äôt feel like I was in a position to do so at the time.

The fundamental problem is that I love her, hate myself for mistakes I have made, feel that both of us would be better off separated, but I worry that divorcing her will be too hard for her emotionally.

I am willing to give her everything of value financially and start over as I think that would redeem myself in my own eyes. I wish there was a way to end things amicably, but I am familiar enough with my own situation to know that is impossible.

To further illustrate our current marital situation, I have suggested couples counseling, but she absolutely refuses since it did not work for her parents and she believes the counseling hurt their chances of reconciling. she and I are currently in individual therapy sessions so that we can deal with issues not born from our marriage, but I feel like I am stuck in an unhealthy situation at this point.

Some context I (35F) and my ex (36M) divorced 2 years ago after 6 years together we had a son together who is now 6 and when he was 4 he was diagnosed with adhd. My ex and I have split custody and i have my son every other week as he does as well. I will probably never tell my son this be the reason of the divorce was him. It was because of his adhd diagnosis. My ex does not believe in adhd and I do. He also just wants our son so he can be a part time dad and part time single man without a care in the world. My sons adhd is severe so he does really need medication at least on school days but when he is with his dad he does not take them. He tells me he does not really care if he takes them or not but he is 6 and I don‚Äôt really think he has an opinion on them yet. All I know is he is extremely self conscious of his adhd and his dad just makes it worse. His dad will tell him that I brain washed him into thinking he is mentally ill. When adhd is not even a mental illness. I feel bad for my son but I want him to have his dad in his life. My son has also told me about his dad making him sit still whne he does stuff or else he gets all devices taken away which is unfair for my son.

"Just need to vent and get some advice. 


[For background, FH is the eldest of 4. From the start of our relationship he‚Äôs made it exceedingly clear he has major boundaries with his siblings. To put it simply there‚Äôs a lot of dysfunction. I would say it stems their parents fostering a very competitive environment in their formative years. So now in their 30‚Äôs it‚Äôs snowballed into to some real malice between with some of them.]


FSIL immediately refused to attend the wedding when she received her invite. She says she doesn‚Äôt approve of the way we‚Äôre doing things. And a whole bunch of other crap that I had to tune out. We‚Äôre having a short engagement (4 months) so she‚Äôs got a load of complaints around that. This is the same person who at FH‚Äôs birthday party last year, put him on the spot saying it‚Äôd be the perfect moment for him to propose. 

2 years ago she sprung a wedding on the family, only giving 2 months notice. Her wedding was abroad to a man the family still doesn‚Äôt know. Whom supposedly she‚Äôd been dating for years prior. Their mom was very disapproving and almost didn‚Äôt attend. 
But that‚Äôs not the case for us. The whole family is so excited and supportive of our big day.
So it‚Äôs pretty obvious where the animosity is coming from. 


FH is used to her shenanigans and basically told her if she doesn‚Äôt want to attend that‚Äôs fine because we‚Äôre not changing a thing. 


Everyone is telling me she‚Äôll come around. Because how could she miss her brother‚Äôs wedding? But I think she‚Äôs petty enough to see this through. 

FH isn‚Äôt letting it get to him, but obviously it‚Äôs bothering him a bit. 


Not sure where to go from here. Do I keep her in the guest count? What if she shows up and tries to cause a scene? What if she apologizes and asks to attend? 

Personally I feel like she‚Äôs just being a big brat about it now but will ultimately attend and be nice. 

TLDR: FSIL is supposedly disapproving of our engagement and refuses to attend the wedding. I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôll ultimately end up attending. I don‚Äôt know how to handle it either way. But I have a feeling she‚Äôll get over it and come and play nice.

"I'm writing this to vent and to see if someone went through something similar. I've been dating my fiance for 6 (or is it 7?) years now and I've always gotten along with all of my in-laws. I've even lived with them for a while and it was actually pretty great, I'd even go out for coffee or for lunch with my MIL and she's always said I'm like a daughter to her.

Now I'm worried I might've done something wrong, because she's so over the wedding.... She's not involved at all, other than to say we should've had invited so and so, and she says things like: ""since it's not a big deal, I'm not going to put a lot of effort on my looks. I'm going to wear trousers and a blouse and that's good enough, right?"" Or ""Ah, you're actually going to wear a wedding dress? I didn't know!"" Well, yeah, that's how it goes, the bride wears a wedding attire. Ugh I'm just so disappointed, my fiance and I thought she was going to be over the moon since her eldest daughter didn't have a wedding party. 

My FIL and MIL are both in the mindset that since we live together, we're already married anyway and that this wedding is a waste of money. It's not even an expensive wedding, out budget was 10k, in the end with a few surprises we ended up spending about 12k accounting for wedding dress, hair, makeup, suit and all of that.

"I have three choices. 
I have to make this decision TONIGHT. My husband will be back tomorrow, at least that is what he said. 

I accept the man I married and disregard any negative treatment towards me and we move forward. 

I continue living at my parents and we separate (I keep the baby)

I leave with the man that just threatened to divorce me...

It‚Äôs a long story; it starts off with our baby who is 8 months old. We are two young kids who moved into my parents house. 
Before when we lived alone my boyfriend at the time would get so mad at me he would scream and curse me. Punched holes in our walls. Abandoned me time after time. Neighbors would knock and ask if I‚Äôm alright. 
When we found out I was pregnant we moved right in to my mom and dads. 
The yelling and punching stopped immediately. 
Except then the yelling came back. And he still was running off at any conflict, intentionally ignoring me, or simply isolating himself. 
I was halfway thru my pregnancy and he threatened to leave. He packed his most valuable possessions and sat in his van and just thought about the choice I guess. 
Well a few hours later he came back in and I of course accepting everything for what it was. With intensely hurt feelings attached. 
Fast forward  we have  our son and it‚Äôs a hell of a night man let me tell you. 
Everything has been so tense between us. My husband threatened to kill himself. He walked out a few weeks before and fearing for his life I called his aunt. She ended up calling the police. He spends a week in the psyche ward where they give him drugs and then release him. 
He has anger about it he has expressed. 
Anyway tonight I am pushed to my limit. My mom yells at me over a trivial thing and I am so unable to control my emotions I just explode. Fast forward again my husband starts threatening to take our son somewhere (he is an exclusively breastfed baby and I don‚Äôt pump extra!) also the last time my husband watch our sweet son he didn‚Äôt change his diaper for hours. Like 5 hours. He got such a bad rash. Worst one he‚Äôs ever gotten. So I do not trust him at all to just take our son and leave. 
He threatened to have me committed to the ward (he does this a lot) 
He threatened to divorce. He packed his stuff in his car. 
He gave me a smile and a peace sign with his fingers and took off. Well he circled the block and then sat. 
He finally came back inside and said he needed to ‚Äúspend time with his son‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt play with him. Just sat there dazed. I played with our boy. 
My husband suddenly just got up and walked to his room closing the door. 
My parents told him he cannot stay here (per my request really, I explained to them he is ALWAYS threatening to lock me up, or take my car and leave, or move away, or divorce, etc.) 
So my husband leaves. Goes to his friends house for a few hours. Then goes to his bosses house where he plans on sleeping. 

He expects me to just pick up our son and follow him out of my parents house. 
I actually want to. My parents house is not the best place to raise my son. It‚Äôs very tense between us often and doesn‚Äôt make for a great environment, however, my husband has hurt himself deliberately in front of our son.

I love him. I do. So much I love him. 
However he said if I stay here with my parents then I am being just like them and he can‚Äôt take it. So I said we get a divorce. And he said no the only way that will happen is if you cheat on me.

"I don‚Äôt know if anyone else has experienced this, but I‚Äôve been mulling it over lately and I need to get this off my chest. Fianc√© and I are in our mid-twenties, getting married on our sixth anniversary next year, and we‚Äôre, uh, terminal loners. We don‚Äôt even live in the same state right now and haven‚Äôt for the past four years. (that‚Äôs for logistical/economic reasons more than anything.) Neither one of us has ever been particularly social, especially me. I‚Äôve never felt comfortable around other women and I struggle to tolerate more than two or three relationships at a time, and those relationships always exist in isolation from each other because the idea of hanging out in a group setting and dealing with group dynamics stresses me out. Fianc√© is an only child who was socially isolated by his *delightful* mother and now as an adult, he‚Äôs very similar to me but probably a bit more amenable to branching out than I am. 

As for family, all I have is a sister and we‚Äôre not close. I have four cousins and I barely know them because I maybe see them twice or three times a year and there‚Äôs a huge age gap. (My parents had us late.) I like my mom‚Äôs side just fine, but if I spend too much time with my dad‚Äôs side I begin wanting to pull my fingernails off. As for fianc√©, his *delightful* mother geographically isolated her family when he was 8 and they all practically fell out of touch with his dad‚Äôs side, and his mom‚Äôs side all lives abroad in various countries. 

Let me clear the air here, **Neither one of us is upset about the way we are. We are not lonely, and neither one of us have social anxiety. This is just our version of normal.** I guess that we hadn‚Äôt realized how social weddings were until we started to plan ours. The last wedding I went to was one of my cousin‚Äôs, about 9 years ago, and my fianc√© has never actually been to one. I cannot think of a single person who I know right now who would invite me to a wedding, and fianc√© definitely can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs little things, like realizing that even if the thought of a bridal shower/bachelorette party didn‚Äôt make me want to roll my eyes out of my skull, I would have no one to invite. Even if the idea of a wedding hashtag didn‚Äôt weird me out to some degree, it‚Äôs very unlikely any of our guests would use it. The day that we first sat down to make a guest list, we realized that between the two of us, we could barely scrape together 30 names and only two of them, besides my sister, were remotely close to us in age. That number eventually jumped to 70 with our parents input. Even ordering invitations and save the dates, we barely make the minimum required number. I also hadn‚Äôt fully grasped how much of a female bonding ritual weddings were until my Pinterest was flooded with bridesmaid gifts and bridal shower ideas and I got some weird and uncomfortable looks when I had to dodge questions about our total lack of a wedding party. 

All of this is making wedding planning hard to get into because it seems like so many things just don‚Äôt fit with the reality of our day, especially since we‚Äôre not having some tiny informal thing. Yeah, our wedding is small, but it‚Äôs a formal evening affair at a museum. When I tell people about this, I get funny looks or comments along the lines of ‚Äúwhat even is the point of doing it like that if you aren‚Äôt going to have a bunch of guests?‚Äù I‚Äôve even had someone ask me why I don‚Äôt just elope if I‚Äôm not having bridesmaids and a massive invite list. It seems like between the well meaning comments and the Entire Wedding Industry‚Ñ¢, the general message is that the way we are is abnormal or wrong, and they don‚Äôt know what to do with us. All of this makes me feel really frustrated because I have always wanted to have a wedding but apparently the way I want to do it bucks convention in a way that makes a lot of people really uncomfortable.

I don‚Äôt know. Right now I‚Äôm just stressed about approaching more vendors with minimums above what we need and if I get one more pitying look or comment about how they feel bad that I won‚Äôt have the ‚Äúfull wedding experience‚Äù I might scream.

"I was never one to dream about my ""fairytale wedding"", and yet in the past months I've become almost obsessively absorbed in planning my wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I was swelling up with excitement at how everything is coming together - my guy put down the deposit on his suit, which will be grey and has elements of his traditional Hungarian culture, my dress will be arriving soon, a soft purple Indo-Western hybrid (I am half Punjabi and half American), and I will wear flowers in my hair ([something like this](https://www.weddingsutra.com/images/wedding-images/bride/purple-lehengas/purple-lehenga-pic1-2.jpg), though a different dress). I thought how our outfits will look so beautiful and complementary and unique together. The pastor who has been our couples therapist for the past two years confirmed that he will officiate our wedding. I'm so excited at the thought of us both standing in front of him at the altar, how meaningful that will be. My bridesmaids will be in blue, and I feel magical imagining them walking down the aisle before me.

&amp;#x200B;

And now today, after talking logistics with my bridesmaids, I'm suddenly stricken with uncertainty. Can I pull my dress off?! What if I just look silly in the end? We are planning all our decorations around the theme of a tree, with the metaphor that our relationship began as a seed and has grown into a tree - so there will be branches hanging from the ceiling with fairy lights, wood slices under candles as the centerpieces, mossy accents, etc. All the sudden I realize that maybe our outfits won't match the centerpieces! Maybe I should be wearing a soft, flowy white dress! Does Indo-Western go with soft woodsy?! Isn't that an awkward clash?

&amp;#x200B;

And trees? Enchanted forest? What if it just looks stupid compared to all these beautiful wedding photos I see online?

&amp;#x200B;

It's like I feel so much pressure to make this night go well. I feel like so many people have thought of me as inexperienced, and chaotic, and unable to plan ahead, and they've been right up, but I've changed since then.

"My family court judge appears to be very wish washy. I was not surprised that my STBXW filed a motion to dismiss my filing for divorce in November 2021 in Michigan. I was very shocked that the judge decided to not only hear that motion, but we'll be heading to trial. 

My STBXW filed for divorce against me last month. Trial date in France isn't until November 22, 2022. At that point we would have been back in the states for a whole year. Mind you we only lived in France from Sept 2021 - November 1st 2021. She left ahead of us, and I returned the kids back to the states with me once I realized divorce was going to happen without her consultation. 

At that time I was advised that I could return back to the states and file for divorce. That I would have to wait 10 days, and then file. 

I'm just shocked it's going to trail. I feel we have a good case. Judge did mention some out of context text messages she had about me asking her if she's going to file in France. 

In January the judge said she thought the kids shoelaces had more ties back to France then them. Now she's letting this to to trial. 

Of course my STBXW strategy is to one delay this process as much as possible, and two to have it ultimately dismissed so her divorce can continue in France come November 22, 2022.

"I've (30F) have been with my husband (35M) for about 10 years. We have been married for 3 years and have a 4 and 2.5 year old. We have a beautiful home and lifestyle we both worked hard for.
Since having children our relationship has taken quite a turn for the worst. 
My husband literally never helped out raising our kids (no feeding, changing, sleeping nearly at all) he has gotten lazier than ever, hardly does anything around the house anymore, he works, comes home, occasionally cooks dinner and is asleep by 8:30 (he doesn't have a difficult job and works maybe 6 hours a day) when I put the kids to bed (he makes zero time for us as a couple, we haven't been on a date in years even though I suggest it often). 
About two years ago things got really bad, I was complaining about how we hardly ever engaged in sex and intimacy, and how we never talk anymore, how he'd always sleeping whenever we have any free time. Anyway the fight got pretty verbally heated and my husband assaulted me (punched me repeatedly). I was pretty shocked by this I didn't report him until nearly a year later.
Prior to reporting this incident to police and about a year on I tried to bury the incident, but I discovered my husband had developed a severe porn addiction. He had money he had been keeping out of our joint bank accounts and hiding and spending on himself (new clothes I didn't know about), while I was expected to share all money (I still and always have worked part time from home so I can still be with my kids and bring in an income). 
Obviously I assumed an affair as to why he had been behaving this way and just using the porn addiction as an excuse (we were still having sex every week to fortnight but this wasn't enough for me and I let him know). But unfortunately I never found any evidence, I checked phone records and bank accounts (all I found was an additional phone and laptop I didn't know he had purchased which he said was for work, but why hide it? But they were both totally clean as well). Additionally since having kids, Ive been getting into better shape (fitter than ever) and he has been just putting on weight (he's about 90kgs now) from 75kg pre babies. I am back to my pre baby 60kgs.
I can't shake the feeling something went on, but he strongly denies it ever had. We have been seperated for 8 months now, still living together, he has been trying a bit harder as a father and going to the gym and shedding some of the weight he put on (mostly for himself by the way, not because I complained) but he's not yet doing so much to be a better husband.

But the boy needs so much love and softness that my husband just doesn‚Äôt show. He needs traditions and surprises and random fun adventures. He needs calming and kind words when he‚Äôs overwhelmed and angered, not more anger and authoritarian rule. I fear for his heart and his confidence. I love him so dearly. 

How do I handle this? So many people have told me that he‚Äôs not my responsibility, it‚Äôs not my child, etc. But I changed his diapers, taught him to read, taught him how to play board games, etc. I deal with the school, doctors, psychiatrists, counselors. I put together his school goodie bags for holidays and pick his party outfits and do his Christmas shopping. I hold him when he cries and love him when he needs help regulating.  

Like‚Ä¶how do you give this up? Is it inappropriate to ask to still see him after the divorce? I have no legal ties to him, other than a power of attorney that expires in a few months. Maybe I could offer to babysit him? I worry about that too‚Ä¶he‚Äôs a LOT and easily frustrates adults. I don‚Äôt want anything bad happening to him at a sitters. He‚Äôs already lost his bio mom (her choice to give him up). This is going to break him. 

I feel so much guilt and sadness for the boy, and none at the idea of leaving my husband. How do I navigate this conversation? He holds all of the power in regard to this. Is asking to see him or have visitation unreasonable or weird? Will it damage him further? Should it be a clean break? I don‚Äôt need to see him every day. I just want to make sure he‚Äôs happy and that he knows that he‚Äôs loved. I don‚Äôt want him to think that it is his fault. 

My daughter knows that we are going to split. She asked this last time when he hit me with my laptop. She is also just so wise beyond her years and perceptive. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. We won‚Äôt split immediately anyway due to how complicated it will be to split assets and debts. But I need to tell him where this is going so we can work together to find a plan that will ensure a smooth transition for everyone. He will also need to find help with stepson, because he can‚Äôt be enrolled in traditional care due to behavior and special needs. I don‚Äôt want anyone to be blind sided or struggling more than necessary. 

This is a lot. If anyone has advice or a story to share, I‚Äôd appreciate it. Hugs.",Divorcing with stepkids,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce
"For a little context, my husband and I dated for about 4 years and got married in our 20s. We didn't rush anything especially with our 2 year engagement since I was still in college. About 3-4 months before the wedding, he comes home and tells me that he sent photos to a porn bot and now he was being blackmailed. I was devastated, but we talked and he said he was going to stop with the bots and I forgave him. 
In our year of marriage, I would still see porn bots on his snap chat and he'd continually give me the same excuse of ""I just wanted someone to talk to"" or ""I'm not sending anything back"". I pushed him to stop, but he never did. Then a few weeks, literally weeks, after our first anniversary I got a message request on Facebook from a girl with a video of him and someone else doing stuff over a video call. I was furious and moved into our guest room. 
It's been a few months now and I've realized how emotionally unavailable he's been and how he tries to downplay guilt trip me because of my feelings I've told him. The thing that made me decide to move was that he confessed that on the night before our wedding, he cheated on me with one of our friends.

I'm moving our tomorrow, but I still don't know if I'm doing the right thing. Will the separation make me realize that I'm doing what's best for me?","Moving out tomorrow, but am I doing the right thing?",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,weddingplanning,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"My fianc√© and I are getting married in September of this year. We chose Minted for our wedding website, because I loved their design options, loved that everything was created by independent designers, and was excited to get various paper products to match the website. I knew it offered online RSVPs, which I wanted, but didn‚Äôt look much further into the feature. 

Fast forward, I am inputting our guest into the site so I can order invites in the near future. I decided to test the RSVP feature, and was really disappointed. Thought I would ask for advice from other Minted couples to see if I can make their RSVP feature work for us before I decide to go with a different online RSVP option. 

The problem: We are having a plated meal, so I need to know which guest in an invited party are coming (for seating chart) and also every single guest‚Äôs meal choice. In my experimenting, there is no good way to accomplish this. The site has you RSVP with number of the invited party attending rather than selecting the names of who is attending (which is what I have seen as a guest RSVPing online). For questions it seems to only allow text box answers rather than multiple choice. So, guest wouldn‚Äôt be able to simply select their meal, but would need to type it in. But since their are multiple people on each invite RSVPing this would complicate the filling in of the text box since multiple meals would need to be listed and we would need to know which guest is selecting that meal. 

My question: What did you do for online RSVP with a minted website? Am I missing something in the creation of the page that would solve my problem? Am I just better off linking to a different site for RSVP?

"Long story short-ish), my daughter (12) got in trouble for being disruptive with a sub in class (she was just talking to her friends, not being rude or offensive or back talking) and her consequence was that she has to call her parents and tell us what happened. She called me first and spent the entire time on the phone freaking out about telling her dad because he still threatens to spank her and her twin brother. 

I was like huh? One of the reasons we grew apart were his antiquated and heavy handed disciplinary practices. (We divorced because he cheated and chose the OW, who then ripped his heart out) When they were small he spanked them and I lost my shit because I don‚Äôt believe in corporal punishment whatsoever. He quit hitting them but still threatened it, which still caused a rift between us because I view it as very damaging to their relationship with him and just their well-being In general. 

So today when she says she‚Äôs afraid of him hitting her over this infraction, I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs lingering fear from when they were little and got doable. I tell her not to worry that I know he would never hit her, and just to tell him she‚Äôs sorry etc. but she‚Äôs still freaking out and saying she wants to go to my house tonight (it‚Äôs his week) so I told her I would talk to him. 

I call him and he admits that he‚Äôs still threatening them with spankings, but that he‚Äôd never actually do it. They are 12. I am not okay with this at all, as I truly believe that they can be reasoned with and grounded or have privileges taken away. Threats of physical violence are never okay in my book. He was incredibly hateful to me and says he‚Äôs just parenting and that I never presented a united front with him and won‚Äôt meet him in the middle - and that‚Äôs wholly untrue, this is just the thing that I finally put my foot down about. I‚Äôve let so much else slide with his harsh parenting behavior that I hate, but I can‚Äôt stand to see my kids scared of him, whether he‚Äôd actually hit them or not, the threats are enough for them to be scared, and me to speak up.

I told him that I understood why he takes this approach but that I don‚Äôt agree with it - nor can I do anything about it, but that it‚Äôs going to end up estranging him from them because they already dread going back to his house because of his temper. He tried to turn it around on me and said that I was villainizing him and driving a wedge. I see it as standing up for my kids against threats. I don‚Äôt talk to them about him or badmouth him in any way, but they did witness him breaking my heart and tearing our family apart due to his unfaithfulness.

I‚Äôm just exhausted by him being hateful towards us. I‚Äôve told my kids that they are old enough to tell him that they‚Äôd rather stay with me full time - but they‚Äôre reluctant because they don‚Äôt want to upset him or hurt his feelings. I told them that there may be a day where the thought of telling him that they want to stay with me full time will hurt less than the thought of actually staying with him every other week. He does not actually hit them and I don‚Äôt think he would. It‚Äôs all bark. We‚Äôll never see eye to eye on this and he‚Äôs a pro at turning it around on me. I‚Äôm just so tired and needed to vent and see if I‚Äôm being unreasonable here.","The kids are struggling with their dad‚Äôs parenting style, which is a big reason we divorced.",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

" This point in my wedding contract comes after a normal point about Force Majeure Events and rescheduling the wedding if one were to occur.

I think Aunt Flo will be here at that time as well, and you all know how we feel when that happens. If I don't feel great about myself that day, I'm afraid I won't like any of the dresses on me.

"Because it seems he‚Äôs still fucking his ex wife. Well, she has more involvement in our marriage than she should. The excuse always was their kids, but it was more than that. The straw that broke the camels back for me was when my husband confronted me about some money he had given to me as a gift and said he wanted back. I told him no, but he kept asking. One day, he waited for me to leave the house to confront me over text message and asked for it back, I told him no. Well, he threw up his ex wife to me and I went off on him about her for the first time. Well, he hired a tow company to pick up my car and left me stranded in the snow. I called a lawyer immediately for a divorce. He seen that immediately by looking through my phone records as we were on a family plan. He called his lawyer and had a petition filed that night. A lot of back and forth and effort put forth on my end to finally get a lawyer to take my case and just recently got my answer filed. He tries to convince me he hadn‚Äôt been working with his lawyer on a divorce for a long time, but I‚Äôm seasoned enough to know you can‚Äôt exactly request a petition be filed with one phone call. A lot has to take place between the lawyer and client before that is usually done. Anyways, long story short, he has since regretted his decision and has been asking me to work with him on this marriage and promises to deal with his ex differently, went to 1 marriage counseling session with me and wants me home for good after he kicked me out and we had movers move the things out of the house after he moved another lady in. We have been on and off since he filed. Trying again and blowing up again, etc. all the while he is filing, gathering and producing evidence behind my back. Well this time I was 4 hours away from home working on getting reestablished, I finally give in and decide okay, I‚Äôll give one last try after he convinced me he‚Äôs done with the games and willing to try. 1hr away from home he calls me and indirectly asks me to be okay with all the drama continuing with ex wife. I refused, blocked his number and turned around to go back on my way. I don‚Äôt understand why this guy wants to play games. Why doesn‚Äôt he go away? If he wants his ex wife, he can have her.

"Myself (24M) and my wife (23F) got married pretty early in our relationship back in 2019. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I was horrible handling this whole situation. For some backstory, I was always the fat kid with no confidence until I started losing weight and had my first girlfriend at like age 18 and we never even kissed, my wife is only my second girlfriend and I didn‚Äôt have much experience with relationships before we got married. Everything started off great as always, I would do everything I could to make her happy and give her a partner like I always wanted. We‚Äôd go out to the beach all the time, Disneyland, boardwalks and just do everything together. Things were good while I was stationed in San Diego. Then things turned south last year when I got orders to Virginia. I procrastinated the moving process, I started becoming a pain around the house because I would get lazy with the chores, complacent with not dating, etc., essentially burning my wife out. We moved at the end of summer last year to a base where I am medical personnel for military students (college age graduates). Last October, a student got injured during an event and I kept contact with her for a sprained ankle. My wife is a jealous person and I didn‚Äôt want her to see I was texting another female. None of these texts were flirtatious or show that I had intentions of anything but I will note that we ‚Äúheart reacted‚Äù each others‚Äô text messages sometimes and I deleted the texts so that my wife wouldn‚Äôt see and become angry with me. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it, but I should‚Äôve known better. Well in November, she came across the texts on my apple watch and that was enough for my wife to become outraged with me. I said the wrong thing to justify it and ended up gaslighting and blaming her which broke her heart. I didn‚Äôt make the situation better by smothering her with apologies and gifts. After a month or so of me doing that, she decided to move in with my parents until she could get her own apartment. Everything was good but I kept overstepping boundaries to try and show her that I was sorry and I loved her. It was stupid of me to do that and not give her the space she also asked for. Last month she finally got her own apartment but didn‚Äôt tell anyone and moved out of my parents‚Äô home without even saying thank you or anything. Since then, she has removed all our pictures from social media, removed me from her social media profiles as a friend/follower, changed her last name back to her maiden name unofficially, and has completely cut off all communication. Although she hasn‚Äôt mentioned divorce, I think that it‚Äôs the only other option since she doesn‚Äôt even want to talk to me anymore.

Ever since she moved out in January, I‚Äôve been going to counseling/therapy on my own accord, reaching out to friends and family for support, talking about my problems, going back to church, and really working on fixing myself so I can bring a better me back to the marriage, but I kept messing up trying to talk with her over the past couple of months and now I realize that it‚Äôs too late and she‚Äôs already disconnected. I finally saw how crappy and toxic of a husband I was and have tried so hard to change my behaviors and be a better person overall, but it‚Äôs become obvious that she wants nothing to do with me anymore. I finally got my act straight, too late. I hate that I ruined my marriage and may possibly have to divorce my wife because we‚Äôve reached this point where she doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge me anymore. I love her so much and would do anything to hold her one more time or see her smile but it seems like that‚Äôs a dream that‚Äôll unfortunately have to remain a dream. We‚Äôve been informally &amp; physically separated for 3 months now and in the past month, she hasn‚Äôt spoken with me at all unless it was for something like taxes. I finally accepted the responsibilities for my actions, apologized, and tried reaching out to her to ask her what she thought about our marriage but no response in two days. This coming Monday, I‚Äôll have to start looking into getting legal advice on what my next steps would be as far as my marriage is concerned, especially if she‚Äôs not communicating anything to me and being silent.

Thank you for reading, please listen to your SO when they talk to you or ask you to do something. If I had respected my wife‚Äôs wishes for space and respected her boundaries, we probably would‚Äôve been able to work this out. Please take care of yourself in marriage and remember to love yourself too, I built a dependency on my wife and it really broke me when she left, leaving me with an identity crisis which I‚Äôm still working on. Please cherish the moments you have with your SO, if I could‚Äôve dated her more, interacted with her more, been proactive with responsibilities so she could trust me more, we wouldn‚Äôt be here.

"My husband (29M) and I (28F) are ending our marriage after ten years together, two married; we have no kids and one mortgage. My husband isn‚Äôt happy about the divorce, but we communicate well and are still living together without any major issues until he can find an apartment. We want to avoid the costs of court since that won‚Äôt help either of us in the end.¬†

Because I‚Äôm the one initiating the divorce, I‚Äôm reaching out to get the process started. After doing some research and finding no local mediation organizations that aren't just family law practices, I emailed a highly rated local attorney's office about their listed mediation services. This was at the beginning of the year and I didn‚Äôt hear back but knew it's supposedly a busy time for family law cases so maybe that was why. After a week or so, I called and left a voicemail. Again, never heard back. Another email with no answer... 

Now, three months later, I‚Äôve had the same experience with three other law offices listing mediation services. Just‚Ä¶.nothing.¬†At all. 

My inquiries include the basic information in my first sentence here highlighting that all we really need is guidance for the division of financial assets, as well as a request for any information they have about their mediation prices, timeline, etc. There‚Äôs nothing, as far as I can tell, that would be a red flag or warrant no response whatsoever.

I‚Äôm getting frustrated and a bit antsy without any movement after several months. Even though we‚Äôre getting along‚Ä¶.there‚Äôs a reason I‚Äôm ending the relationship and being stuck in limbo has been an emotional slog.¬†

What am I doing wrong in my search for mediation? This seems like it will be a slam dunk easy deal from the mediator's end of things. Is it because it‚Äôs not a court-ordered mediation that I‚Äôm not hearing back? Someone suggested that maybe the lawyers know it‚Äôs not worth their time because there won‚Äôt be enough billable hours. Someone else said maybe it‚Äôs easier just to file the paperwork ourselves. I can probably handle that, but it really makes my stomach knot up thinking about going it alone without some professional input.

I‚Äôve never been in this situation and want to be sure everything is done correctly and fairly.

"**Context:**

I am part of an international couple. My husband's side of the family is HUGE, from a country where they need to apply for visas to come to the US (logistically complex), and their currency is significantly weaker (so everything is *literally* 10x more expensive for them). Therefore, we decided to have our ""main wedding"" in his home country. I actually prefer this because I think their traditions are more meaningful (e.g., his mother hand-sewing a full traditional bridal outfit for me, traditional dances, etc.) and it gives me more opportunity to bond with his family. For us as the couple, it's better. We prefer it. We're happy with it!

As a compromise, we wanted to have a small dinner with the rest of the family in the US. Not a full-blown reception, but a really nice dinner and maybe something like a wine tour (all paid for guests). It will still cost us a decent amount of money, but the goal is to have something that's nice for our family and friends to come together and celebrate. We're *not* trying to double our wedding costs by having a second full-blown reception and we're hoping our close friends and family are understanding about that.

If some of my family members don't want to travel for something as simple as that, we're ok with that. We get it. But we are doing our best to make it worth any travel as best we can.

**My plan:**

Get a really beautiful but small venue where we can have a nice, quiet dinner (rehearsal dinner or anniversary dinner type of vibe), possibly with the cheesy, heartfelt speeches. But not a party. Not a dancefloor with a DJ and open bar. Nothing with crazy planning for all the table favors (that people tend to throw out anyway), signs, extravagant flowers, etc. A *dinner*. Just. A. Dinner.

I thought it would be more fun if some of that extra money that would go toward the extraneous stuff mentioned above went toward an experience like a wine tour, boat trip, or something else that's more like an (optional) experiential day trip. So people can enjoy the full weekend.

Then, to top it all off, if people want to come to our home for a brunch (also functions like the house-warming party we haven't had yet) that Sunday morning before they travel back home, we will host that, as well.

Personally, I know that I've driven/flown to meet my family members for much less. So I find it hard to think that this is ""too cheap"". I think it shows effort while being realistic with a budget and also being thoughtful. When you have two families coming together, especially across oceans, you won't satisfy everyone. I believe it's obvious we're putting genuine effort into this.

**My family:**

As mentioned above, I thought my plan was enough, particularly given the circumstances. But at every single turn, my mom has an opinion and it is mostly about how, well, she thinks it's not enough. I guess she's embarrassed by the idea, as if it's too cheap, not worth the trip. Which is convenient since she believes my dad is paying for all of this (which I explicitly never asked for or insisted that, that's her own storyline; I don't want to oblige anyone for this).

For example, she called my sister (without me asking her) to discuss the *very important issue* that is... having a DJ. She insisted that the dinner would be morning and not worth people's while if it's quiet with no music. And called me in a fuss about it.

Just small details like that which, I honestly don't think matter at all. I'm getting really tired of it. She's constantly trying to add on extra stuff when we were clear about this being simple.

\---

So... am I being unreasonable? I'm really doing my best here and trying to keep the focus on it being a celebration of our family and friends together, not some unnecessary decorations that no one remembers anyway.

If it comes to it and it apparently *is* that important to have all these small things I consider trivial, I'd honestly rather not deal with the stress and just cancel it. It's supposed to be a happy celebration, not a burden. If people don't want to come, it's unfortunate, but at this point, realistically speaking, it's pretty impossible to please everyone anyway.",My mom hates every idea I have for my own wedding and it's making me want to just not have one.,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning

"I had two appointments at Brides for a Cause this weekend so I thought I would share my experience. 

[website](https://www.bridesforacause.com/)

All the dresses are donated by salons, retailers or brides. The dresses ranged from used to samples to brand new. I visited the Tacoma WA store on Saturday and the Seattle WA store on Sunday. There are stores in Portland OR and Sacramento CA as well. Each store will vary on stock based on who donates where. Their Instagram is updated when new dresses are donated. The funds raised go to charities for women. 

The Setup
I was allowed up to 3 guests to accompany me. The rules were that if I was looking at dresses then my entourage could be looking at dresses but if I was back trying on dresses then the group had to be there. I was allowed to try on 5 dresses at a time. There was no consultant directly helping me so it was nice to browse on my own because I am extremely introverted and awkward with new people. I did have to have my mom zip me and clip me into the dress since I didn‚Äôt have a consultant. So definitely bring someone with you. There were stylists around who did bring dress suggestions and accessories. 

The Dresses
Because the dresses are donated the sizes available very greatly. If you are a bridal 10, you are in luck because that is the common sample size and there were over a hundred dresses at the Tacoma store. There are definitely some designer gowns. I managed to find a Hayley Paige dress at both stores. I tried on a beautiful Alexander Grecco gown at the Tacoma store. I ended up with a brand new Augusta Jones gown that retails for $3000 for $650. 

That being said, these were dresses in various conditions. The AG dress I tried on was listed at $850 and had a broken zipper that would have needed repair on top of alterations. Some of the beaded dresses were a little worse for wear given the nature of beading. But overall I would say that dresses were beautiful and beyond my expectations for donated dresses. 

Pros

"I (40f) told my SO (42m) I wanted a separation at the beginning of January. We have been together for 17 years, married for 9. It's been tough. We are cohabitating but it's been unpleasant. We are barely talking, when we do we usually fight. But I only see him a few times a week as he seems to be so busy working. I've been wondering whether or not I made the right call... Maybe it would be easier to just stay. 

One of my boys (5) asked for a roast dinner. Well it's just silly to make that for me and 3 kids, 5 and under... So I invited him to join us. Made a nice roast beef, sweet potatoes, mushrooms and asparagus. While we were eating, I got really sad realizing that this would be one of the last family dinners we will have. It was easy and comfortable. It was a very nice evening...

"While living in Texas in 2020, I realized I had to end my marriage. One big issue was that I was making all the money while she spent it. She enjoyed a nice lifestyle but did absolutely nothing to contribute. No job, no housework, no cleaning, nothing. Normally she would be entitled to her nice lifestyle after the divorce. But in Texas she was limited to 20 percent of my income until she could collect SS in five years. The divorce was granted in 2021 with the 20 percent in support mandated. She was still cheaper as an ex than as a wife. 

Sadly, both her parents died in 2021. Now the other part of Texas law kicked in. Because she inherited more than the sum of remaining support payments, I went back to court and had the support cut off. I am done and she‚Äôs off my back two and a half years later.

"So, long story short, my STBXW abandoned me and our two toddlers almost a month ago. She decides to get her own attorney after my attorney sent her an agreement letter with all the financial information, custody, etc. obviously she didn't like the terms so lawyered up. Cool, it's her right. 

Anyways, she has this strong impression that she can have custody of our children and have me paying child support even though she left without even a note to live with her AP in another state. I'm in VA she's in GA.

We‚Äôre having a fairly large wedding party that isn‚Äôt split by bride/groom side, just a big clump of friends &amp; fam.

"Alright, all advice on this is appreciated. 

FH and I got engaged in 2020 after he postponed doing it 3 different times (dad got sick and later passed quickly, then Covid shut down #1, then Covid shut down #2). We set a date for June 2022 on December 1 2020.

FH and I have been together for 10 years. He has known my family a long time and we are all close. FH asks my sibling to be best person in February of 2021. I ask their girlfriend to be my bridesmaid as they have been together for 4+ years. 

Recently, my mom announces (we also all work together) that it‚Äôs less than 90 days to go to the wedding. We all say yay and are excited and move on with our day. 

Next day, my sibling (has had a drink or two ++) decides to tell my mom first they are going to propose to their gf in the next few weeks and wants her blessing. She‚Äôs a little taken aback, happy but startled as it‚Äôs a little out of nowhere and after a few beverages. 

FH and I proceed to go to another bar with my sibling (same night) and they tell us their plans. They also state they want to do it the weekend before we all go on a bachelor/bachelorette joint party. And they want to elope 3 weeks before our wedding. 

I am stunned/upset/drunk/happy/sad/angry that night. I proceed to have a complete melt down (just with FH) about the timeline of it all.

"So.
It's hard to explain, but my husband is strange. I cannot talk to him. Any time I've tried to express my feelings he turns it around, makes me feel terrible, and I end up comforting him and apologizing for my feelings.

I want a divorce. I have wanted one for years, but I have been afraid to tell him. The last time I tried to break up with him, he sliced his wrists and laid under my car so I couldn't leave. I ended up picking him up off the floor and staying.

I don't want to stay anymore. But I'm so terrified of initiating the conversation. Part of me thinks writing a letter is so very cowardly and awful-as it doesn't really allow the other person to express their side. But...I never get to fully express myself! And at this point, I don't want to hear his side. I don't want him to manipulate me into staying. There's nothing he could say or promise that would change my mind.

 Would a letter be just awful?

We do still live together, for now, so it is not like we won't get to discuss it. I just want to get everything out without getting caught up in emotion, or being interrupted. The letter isn't condemning, finger pointing, or a ""you're a shitty person"" list. It is a simple ""I am unhappy and need to leave"" without a big list of reasons.

Please help, as I am a nervous wreck, but I HAVE to get this message across. I cannot wait anymore. Every year I promise myself I will leave and I have been too scared to do so.

"As we work through the mediation process and division of our limited assets, etc., it is so discouraging to recognize some of the defense mechanisms I developed over nearly 20 years now that I don't need to employ them. I am enjoying the freedom from trying to smooth things over in the house so they don't get upset, make life easy peasy for them so they don't feel burdened, walking on eggshells, trying to anticipate and fulfill needs, explain my whereabouts, activities, and expenses... It's been great! And we're not even that far into things yet. 

It does make me so sad that this is who I am coming out of it, though. My first instinct is to engage these behaviors in all interactions, to defer to them and appease them even without any reason or stated expectation from them. These are the battle scars that are going to take time to unravel and work through.

My concern as we work through mediation is that I will struggle with self-advocacy and asserting myself to fight for the things I want and need coming out of this marriage. I understand a mediator is impartial, working for both and neither of us; we need to agree to things on our own, but sometimes that is hard. I really hope we can finish this through the mediator, but do not want to crumble and just go along with whatever because it's my default setting.

"Fair warning that this post will be a long one. 

I have been wanting this for a long time now. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm scared to move forward. Afraid that I‚Äôll be making a mistake and hurting my child in the process. We have been married for 10 years. I had just turned 20 when we tied the knot. Most of my adult life has been with him. And for 9 years we had a tumultuous relationship. I tried for years to do things in a way that would make him happy and less angrier at me. But he would gaslight me and manipulate the situation. He would claim that he put me on a pedestal to try and please me and even after all that, I never loved him. Even to this day. 

In our early years together, he would often compare me to his ex or tell me that I wasn‚Äôt contributing to the relationship. I was young and stupid. I grew up in a broken family. My parents divorced when I was 3 and it was ugly. It stayed ugly up until my dad‚Äôs death in 2018. And even now my mom won‚Äôt stop shitting on him. I just tune her out now. So, I never learned what a healthy relationship was or how to react when something upset me. Anyway, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve been any better. I‚Äôve said my fair share of nasty things and many things that I‚Äôve ever regretted saying to him. I know. We are absolutely toxic. To each other and everything we touch. I‚Äôm so sorry my son is in the middle of it. And I want better for him. 

Most recently we have been arguing. Fighting. I‚Äôm so tired. I just want it to stop. I just want to be heard and seen. But as soon as the arguments start, it goes and goes. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever see the light at the end of the tunnel. Maybe if I continue like this, I‚Äôll never find it. He‚Äôll argue his points and I‚Äôll apologize. And only after I apologize will he realize the weight of his actions and start reflecting. Then he‚Äôll promise me that he‚Äôs going to work on it. And the cycle continues into the next day and here we are again. I can‚Äôt even share how I feel without him feeling like I‚Äôm throwing daggers at him. Even when I use ‚ÄúI‚Äù sentences. I‚Äôm not perfect and I am trying to own up to my anger problems. Like finding a healthier way to release my anger. But every time he says something to me, all I see is red. And he‚Äôll say things that he knows will trigger me. This morning he told me he threw away my seeds that I had kept in the garage to plant this spring. I haven‚Äôt had time to plant them yet but figured I still had some time left. I was upset and told him so. But his response was, ‚ÄúWell, if you knew you still needed them, you should have put them somewhere else. They were out in the garage for a long time and just sat there.‚Äù Then proceeded to tell me that that‚Äôs what I do with all my stuff. So, I need to pile them up so he can put them in the attic. We don‚Äôt have an attic. We have a crawl space that I would have to cut open because it‚Äôs a newly built home. 

In my culture (I‚Äôm of Asian decent if that matters) a divorced woman is frowned upon. Everything leading up to the divorce is her fault. I don‚Äôt care about culture. All I want is my son to learn that he can walk away from people and situations that are toxic. However, I know that if I file for divorce I will have no support from my parents because of our culture. I don‚Äôt know where to go. My mom will blame me that I‚Äôm making a mistake. And if my husband files for divorce, well then I must have done something to deserve it. Damned if I do and damned if I don‚Äôt. 

We just built this home last July. I didn‚Äôt want to move here because it would mean an extra hour of driving back and forth to drop our child off at his parents (my mother-in-law is a sweetheart and insists on watching him). But he somehow convinced me that it would be fine. We also purchased a new car in October. He‚Äôs not going to go down without a fight. He wouldn‚Äôt even allow a divorce. He wants to work on our relationship and doesn‚Äôt feel like a divorce is going to help. He has this idea that we can work through it and we‚Äôll grow old together. But I can‚Äôt stay like this anymore. I feel like I am suffocating. I feel like there‚Äôs no way out. I don‚Äôt have the money to get a place of my own. I can‚Äôt afford a divorce lawyer. A long time ago used to see him in my future and believed we‚Äôd be together for a long a time. But I don‚Äôt want this anymore. I look back at our relationship and it was built on manipulation and false promises. There was a time on St. Patty‚Äôs day in 2014 when I spent the day with his sister and friends, he refused to come pick me up. He said if I got there I must know a way home. I called my stepdad that night to pick me up. There are other countless times when I‚Äôve had to crawl my way back to him. But now, I just want to be with my son. I don‚Äôt want this anymore. I finally see this relationship for what it really is. Please tell me that there‚Äôs a way. That I‚Äôll finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. That if I start this that I‚Äôll be ok?

"I have made up my mind to divorce my husband. At this point, the anger and resentment I feel for empty promises and unaddressed issues in our relationship is more than I can handle. Though I love him dearly, it's more like the love you have for a close friend, someone you know deeply and intimately. We have had dead bedroom issues for close to a year at this point, so I don't view him as a sexual partner, and hardly a romantic one. 

And that's the problem. I do love him. He has depression and anxiety, and is extremely prone to unhealthy coping mechanisms like excessive drinking, and he has had mental breakdowns in the past. He has said things to me like, ""I would kill myself if I didn't have you"", and has also used suicide as a weapon to hurt me before. If I leave, he will, without a doubt, hurt himself. And I know rationally that is not my responsibility, but the thought of hurting someone you love so much is excruciating. 

I know many of you will suggest couples counseling, and I'm just not sure that will help. I don't feel romantic towards him anymore, and I have no desire to be romantic with him anymore. It's just over in my heart, and I'm devastated.

"Hi! 
I (22F) live with my younger sibling (18F) my parents and my grandmom. My parents have been married for 23 years now. But it‚Äôs only now that I have come to realise that they are not in a good marriage sort of relationship and what I find better for them is to lead their own individual lives. My dad happens to be the sole earner now while my sister and I both happen to be studying. Which leaves us with no other source of income. So, even if i consider suggesting my mother to rent a flat and live, managing finances would become a huge issue. Especially when we are not even financially well off. Which makes the separation even harder. And like every indian family, divorce is a taboo and sustaining marriage (whether good or bad) is highly looked up to. So, my question to the indian reddit community is that even if i consider separation as a real option here, then how should I help my mom become financially independent? She‚Äôs not much educated but she is good with the managing task. Also, she‚Äôs 50+ and has medical issues. So even i am a bit apprehensive about her working but sometimes you just have to. Still better than dying each die within four walls of a room, right? What job options, or career choices can i pitch to my mom? How can i help her lead her own life? Any genuine help would be a blessing honestly.

"Hi All. Throwaway account as my previous account was compromised.

Backdrop to my story, wife cheated with a coworker 18 months ago and left me for him. We have two kids, I was in a bad place for a while but out the other end now and doing quire good.

I'm in the UK, well a small island just off the UK. I was passive on the divorce and let her get on with it. We split finances 50/50 and settled into a routine that worked for me (cos of my job) but I always maintained I wanted 50/50 when I could make it work. I did this recently and proposed a solution. I currently have them every weekend which I have done for 18 months and she doesn't like that. The solution helps that problem and also frees up my time to move on with my life.

Anyway....... she rejected it and said I'm not having them 50/50 cos she is their mother and her life is more geared up to looking after children. They are 12 &amp; 10 so not exactly babies anymore. I had my first solicitor appointment yesterday and presumed this would be a simple case of 50/50 but didn't come out feeling massively confident. She said child welfare would get involved to assess what the kids want, I'm not too bothered about that but strongly believe she will coerce them into her thinking.

Sooooo.... I'm just wondering if anyone else has a similar experience on getting a 50/50 split. I can make it work with my job, I live near my ex and schools and there isn't really a valid reason why not but I'm just really anxious about the whole thing. I moved away so my ex could be closer to her family so other than the kids, I don't have anyone else close by.

"TL;DR My ex is abusing an ex parte order for temporary physical custody and restricting access to my son after filing a bogus DCF report against my roommate after a year long campaign of trying to make me look like a bad father. Looking for advice on how to use the tools available for pro-se representation.

It's been a slog to get to 50/50 custody with my ex and we were following a 2-2-3 since April 2021. My ex has never wanted to co-parent with me and she made this painfully obvious leading up to and following the divorce. I've done my best to deal with her constantly accusing me not acting in our 3yo son's best interest because I am forcing him to split time between two houses. Meanwhile filing motions of contempt for when she canceled the registration for his preschool once she moved to a different town (and wanted one closer) and keeping him on my days including holidays.

The first casualty of my ex's battle was getting rid of the original co-parenting counselor (appointed by a GAL in the initial divorce proceedings) which unfortunately wasn't hard. He was extremely unprofessional and made lewd comments to both of us but he got the job done so I just dealt with it. It only helps my ex to attack his credibility because any third party becomes very aware how unwilling she is to actually co-parent.

This happened in September 2020 and I have been trying to engage her to new counseling but she kept refusing for months. She even offered up a mediation center and when I called to do the intake she then refused claiming I had called them first and ""talked to them"". Apparently intake of my email and contact info is an unfair advantage.

All while this is happening she's making claims that at her house and her house only my son has tantrums, threw food on the floor because I gave him unhealthy food at lunch (I'm a certified health coach and trainer for the last 14 years mind you), and just making every possible accusation possible. She even went as far as to file a police report saying I threatened to kill her on a phone call. 

Fast forward to Feb 2022 and I finally get her to another counselor where she continues her lies and now she makes claims that I never did a background check on my roommate (I did and sent it to her last year). Right before our second session she tells me my son informed her my roommate stuck his tongue in his mouth. I'm appalled and am immediately skeptical because of who my ex is and because I feel confident based on the content of the accusation but take action after such a serious accusation. I buy a camera for my son's room and try to get details from her but she's tight lipped.

Then the DCF workers call me and the detective from my town to start the investigation. I have to sign something that I would co-sleep with my son and not have him around my roommate. That would have been enough but not for my ex. She files an ex parte which gets granted and it says she can dictate my time with my son (according to her attorney) even though it says access can happen regularly as long as it doesn't occur at my home. What makes it worse is my ex will only let me see my son supervised at her house. She quotes my bad behavior and comments to why I can't take my son.

I literally went from a happy normal life of a 2-2-3 with my baby boy to not being able to see my son. Anyone have any experiences fighting these kind of orders? I have a shit ton of proof in text messages of her constant unwillingness to comply with the agreement and make my life hell and I can get people to speak up to how good my son is with me but I don't know if it will be enough.",Ex-Wife Abusing Ex-Parte Order To Force Supervised Visits With Son,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"Most weddings I go to, mainly family ones, the bride and groom don‚Äôt do a speech. My soon to be wife said that she always sees couple speeches at weddings and is surprised I thought it wasn‚Äôt a thing.

We still have 3 toasts planned but it‚Äôll be: maid of honor, father of groom, father of bride.

Our plan is to do ours as a welcome speech at the start of the reception, then dinner service, then the 3 toasts. So it‚Äôs spaced out.

I‚Äôm kinda excited by the idea of doing a speech. It‚Äôs a smaller size wedding (65 guests) so unless I‚Äôm being narcissistic I feel like the room of just close family and friends would love to hear from us. And 5 minute speech, 40 min dinner break, then 3 toasts roughly 2-4 minutes each doesn‚Äôt sound too lengthy or tiring.

It felt like a dress rehearsal. I have major dress regret, I couldn't lose the weight I wanted to, I wish I had chosen a different hair style, I didn't feel as clean as I wanted to despite having gotten up extra early to bathe and shave, my nails were all wrong, I couldn't find the beautiful pearl belt that was meant to go accent my dress and ended up not using it, and I just overall felt underwhelmingly average.

"We booked our venue today for a wedding THIS June (yes we're insane), and they have an in-house caterer/bar service. The brochure states that open bar service is provided under the assumption (and cost) of at least 100 guests in attendance at $15 per person. Our original list isn't really near 100 guests, especially when you account for the people that will not be able to come. I have maybe 20 guests total (and I'm nearly 100% sure they would all come) while my fianc√© has probably around 50 that he is fairly confident would come or would make an effort to be there. 

We were concerned about paying for extra guests, but understand that the bar service needs to make a profit too, and apparently a smaller party is a loss to them when they factor in the staff expenditures, time, etc. The policy doesn't seem to extend to food, so it's not as if we are paying for 100 meals no matter what on top of the bar fee. At the meeting today the consultant said they will work with us for a smaller group, but typically want at least 75 people for the catering/bar aspect.

My fianc√© now feels we should extend more invitations with the expectation that a fair number of them will respond ""no"", so that our party will certainly be large enough to justify the catering, but I'm unsure if that's a good idea. We're also welcoming people to bring their kids and I'm not sure yet of how many people will go ahead and do so, which could really inflate the situation in my eyes. There are distant/non-local relatives that we are almost certain would not come, but I'm concerned about having more people say yes than we expect. Then again, I see where he is coming from that if we only invite our original guest list of maybe 80-90 people (which does not include the children), then we can expect that some will not be able to make it and we will fall below the caterer's ideal minimum. 

This is a semi-destination wedding (over 1-2 hour drive for most guests) and with a group that likes to party. What do you guys think of my fiance's line of thinking here in inviting more people than we originally planned on? And would you assume that many people, if given the option, would choose to bring their kids to a wedding like this? 

If you read all of this, thank you, and I appreciate your thoughts.","Is it ever a good idea to inflate your guest list expecting that a decent percentage will RSVP ""No""?",weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning

However, I‚Äôve had some trouble getting in touch with my caterer after a rescheduled tasting where she was functionally absent and we weren‚Äôt able to have the conversation with her we‚Äôd been promised. 

When I finally did hear back from her on the questions we had planned to discuss during the tasting, she gave us a lot of very stressful answers essentially saying they weren‚Äôt going to do various services we had contracted them to do. I was literally sick to my stomach until her weekly ‚Äòoffice hours‚Äô when my fianc√© called her. She reiterated that she doesn‚Äôt do set up or take down (which they advertise in their website and we were very explicit about wanting in our inquiry, and have discussed with her several times) and then about halfway through the conversation bothered to look at our contract and realized we had paid for it. She said they will do take down but that we‚Äôll have to have our rental company do set up. Our contract is ambiguous on this, I‚Äôm now realizing. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs malicious, she just strikes me as disorganized, but if she had paid any attention to our inquiries she would have known at the time we drafted and signed the contract that we were interested in set up services. They also won‚Äôt do things like move the chairs from the ceremony space to the reception space, and I have literally no idea how to get that done at this point without asking guests to help‚Äîwhich I explicitly don‚Äôt want to do.

I have supported him through everything, and he always says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where I would be without you, I‚Äôd be lost‚Äù, but even that sentence is about him and his needs. I completely lost myself in my supporting role to him. I‚Äôve molded myself into perfect wife for him. He cares so much about what other people think of him, so he loves the fact that he has a ‚Äúcool, model looking wife‚Äù so in front of other people (friends, acquaintances and such) he treats me with hearts in his eyes because he enjoys the flex when women say ‚Äúoh I want my man to treat me like he treats her‚Äù.

Always needs reassurance from me to tell him how smart he is, how hot he is, how good he is and he full blown throws tantrums when I don‚Äôt compliment him as frequently as he wants.

"Currently trying to decide if I should attend my friend's wedding.

Her wedding is happening in May, specifically on Memorial day weekend and on the East coast. Traveling will be involved as a majority of her friend's family and friends live on the West Coast. Traveling to her wedding has been very costly and she is asking for money as a gift on top of everything.

She has not been communicating much about her wedding. She sent out invitations but had no information to RSVP. As a guest we had to deduce to look at her website for more information, which she didn't finish making so we have to directly contact her to get any clarification.

Texted her to figure out what is going on as her wedding is two months away. She said that people had been RSVP-ing on the website.

Here's where my problem is. I mentioned that I'm planning my way to her wedding and her response was:
""Yeah don't stress yourself out about it. I know tons of people are coming since they're overseas or working so no pressure""

This rubbed me the wrong way. When I read this, it made me feel like she doesn't care if I were to show up or not. Am I reading too much into her response? It's her wedding and her day, but all I could think that this a friend of 13 years who said she wanted me to be her maid of honor. She is no longer having bridesmaids, and I'm guessing that because again she hasn't said much since about a year ago when she told me that she would want me to be her MOH.

I've truly been debating if I should even go to her wedding. Before this exchange I wasn't sure if I would go because she talked so much shit about my own wedding at my wedding. She had told me that she had forgotten about my wedding and texted me a month before about RSVP-ing, and the weekend of my wedding asking about attire.

"Married nearly 3 years, together for close to 20. Live in Pennsylvania.

We both came into the marriage with our own assets - him: a house, his furniture and stuff, a car, 401k. Me, the same.

Since getting married we purchased another ATV (with cash and it's ""mine"" - he has his own) and my current car that is mine but in his name only (paid off).

His house is not worth a lot but it is worth more than mine, as mine is a mobile home. 

We've been saving to buy a home together, the plan was to sell both of our homes, but I don't feel the marriage will survive until then. 

I've not talked to an attorney yet, but if we do divorce, is it possible for us to just walk away with what we came in with and what was bought along the way? For example, I just want my house, car, ATV, my 401k, etc. I don't need to split things 50/50 (if his house is worth more then mine, for example. Another example, he has tons of tools.

TLDR: Mom and Aunt‚Äôs toxic drama is ruining our wedding 

Heads up that this will be long. The wedding is in a month and the drama between my mom and aunt is making my fianc√© and I extremely upset. It all started when we had made the choice to only invite our immediate family - grandparents, parents, siblings. My aunt (mom‚Äôs sister) was upset she wasn‚Äôt invited and she told my mom in the phone that she didn‚Äôt want to hear anything else about the wedding. My mom and aunt have had a very toxic relationship. My mom was hurt by this and I felt bad my aunt was hurt, but also mad at what she said to my mom. 

A few weeks after this, I explained to my aunt that I of course would love for her to be there, but we had to make a cutoff. My fianc√© has 10 aunts and uncles and we wanted the wedding to be super small so our close family could get to know each other better. She said it was ok and that she understood. 

Fast forward several months and we came to the decision to invite my aunt to the ceremony because my family is super small and we decided to throw a large party where all the family was invited. However, we weren‚Äôt inviting her partner (he is invited to the party though) because we felt like we were walking a fine line with possibly upsetting my fianc√©s mom since her siblings weren‚Äôt invited. Before I got a chance to talk to my aunt to explain, my mom blurted out to her on the phone that she is invited but not her partner. My aunt got very mad, and my mom and her haven‚Äôt talked directly since. I texted my aunt to explain the situation and she seemed to understand. Edit: forgot to say that despite me texting my aunt to explain, she then accused my mom of telling me not to invite her partner. 

Fast forward to last weekend when I was surprised with a bridal shower that I had asked not to have. Apparently my fianc√©s cousin planned it last minute and didn‚Äôt include my mom or sister, but invited my aunt. My mom was extremely hurt by this and then decided that my fianc√©s mom is a ‚Äúbad person‚Äù for not thinking to invite her and proceeded to block my MIL and my aunt on Facebook. I tried to tell my mom that my MIL had told me I could invite more family, but I didn‚Äôt because I felt awkward about the whole thing. My mom still resents my MIL for not tagging her in a family post of all of us on Facebook ‚Ä¶. Which happened 3yrs ago. My mother is insane. 

So‚Ä¶ today my aunt texts me and asks if my mom deleted her FB. I didn‚Äôt know what to do so I texted my mom and told her. When she called me, I freaked out and told her to try to fix this because it‚Äôs all upsetting me. My mom and I have some deep issues and she is the only person in my life that creates drama. She then got mad at me saying she has the right to block people for her mental health. 

Once I told my fianc√© all of this, he proceeded to go into a full rage. He‚Äôs sick of the stupid drama and is furious at them both. He now doesn‚Äôt even want to have the wedding with them there. 

I seriously don‚Äôt know what to do. My mom is completely unreasonable and difficult and my fianc√© wants to uninvite my aunt. I can‚Äôt believe how blind they are to their pettiness, immaturity, and selfishness.",Family drama is getting out of control,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning

"Has anyone here ever regretted a divorce? I just want to run away from everyone I know and start completely over. I wasn‚Äôt happy in my marriage because my spouse seemed to just despise me and wasn‚Äôt ever happy to have me around. He always yelled at me and would gaslight me. He always pointed out something negative about me. Never mentioned anything nice or positive. But even though there‚Äôs all this terribleness, I still loved him. Even though I walked on eggshells 90% of the time, he was my best friend. I‚Äôve never connected with anyone else like that before. Two weeks before I filed for divorce he told me he didn‚Äôt care if our marriage worked or not and that he had nothing to be happy about. He said some messed up things about raising our kid too. And he couldn‚Äôt tell me one thing he liked about me other than that I‚Äôm a good mom.

"Hi, I'd love to hear experiences from anyone who has experienced something like this.
I (M36) was split up with by my wife of 12 years (f35), we have 3 kids. I did most things right and provided well, but she had an affair with a colleague on a worm trip and blew up everything abruptly and was very definitive. I was crushed but accepted it.

I moved out of the house, gave her nearly all the assets. Seeing kids was fine, until she became single within a few months and after a successful family court appearance (for a male!), we now have shared care.

I've since had a glow up, am dating a (f24), have a great relationship with my kids and am living my best life. All I'm receiving from her is pure toxicity and games though. A refusal to discuss the children, lawyers letters over petty matters and seems to be a lot of anger and blame. Changeovers usually result in her yelling and slamming doors, the emotions are never reciprocated. I've heard that her career, dating app experience hasn't been great.

Despite all of this, most of the school Mom's have her side completely and she's even told them not to deal with me or invite my kids to things while in my care. The general consensus seems to be, she must have a good reason for it. The sisterhood is strong, I'm jealous!

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Would appreciate ladies opinions in particular here as I just want to move on but it seems impossible! I just want a cohesive co-parenting relationship with kids and for us both to move on!! What do I do??

My wife and I are young in our mid thirties. We've been married for 10 years or so. When we first got together she always was sick and in pain honestly and I feel bad about this I always just thought she was complaining for a hypochondriac. Just recently in the last year have we discovered that she has an autoimmune disease that I'd never heard of called ankylosing spondylitis and she's had it since she was 6 or 7. Growing up her doctors always told her she just had growing pains but she had extreme issues and she's now divulged to me that she knew she had to marry someone that would work and take care of her because she would never have been able to hold down a job. We have been having extreme issues and we are probably getting a divorce but the guilt of her never working and not being able to support herself is killing me. I've worked our entire relationship and when we split up she will have no income. She certainly cannot work a laborious job or anything like that due to essentially having extreme fatigue pain and roughly 50% of the time being bedridden. I guess I'm just wondering what options she may have is there any form of disability she could qualify for?

"I kept my word and had the talk last night with my STBXW. I started by admitting all the times she pointed out how selfish I am with decisions was exactly what I needed to hear. I brought up examples from old and recent events where my inability to compromise has either led to fights or her suffering in silence over never getting her way. I told her of my fears of letting this go on, constantly in a cycle of making her wants and needs forever secondary. She agreed with most of what I was saying, not knowing where this was going.

And then she cut me off. ""Are you leaving me?"" She wanted a straight shot answer. I told her that's what this conversation was all leading to and yes.

There we're tears and hyperventilating like you can only imagine. She got herself so worked up she threw up all in our bed while we were talking. She wanted to barter anything she thought she could give up to make me change my heart. She tried blaming herself for my feelings of rigidness. She insulted all the years we have invested by calling them wasted.

 And then strangely, something I didn't expect, straight up obstinance. She told me I wasn't allowed to leave her. When I went downstairs to sleep on the couch after about 2 hours of going in circles,  she followed me and wouldn't let me go to sleep until I at least agreed to sleep still in the bed with her. I don't recommend this, but i gave her what she wanted. I wouldn't face her while I slept and I wouldn't cuddle or hold her.

It's 8:15 EST here, her phone alarm went of at 7:30. She got up, grabbed a handful of things from the closet and bathroom and has left the house. 

My brother text me and said she was on her way to the house to spend the day with them,  admittedly this is the outcome I hoped for. My brother and his wife adore her and are the exact support system she can count on in these uncertain days/weeks we'll be facing. 

How do I feel? Sad but relieved. Uncertain yet peaceful. My only wish is some healing can now begin.

We‚Äôve reached out to venues that we like and Saturdays are pretty much booked. :( The two venues we like the most only have Sundays available in March - no Fridays. We really don‚Äôt want to postpone again (we would probably have to postpone to November 2023 due to Florida weather)‚Ä¶

Some info about our guest list:
- Most of my fianc√©‚Äôs family work in the restaurant industry and his parents have expressed that Fridays and Saturdays would be more difficult for them
- Most of my fianc√©‚Äôs friends work in tech with M-F schedules so they would probably have to take Monday off
- 90% of guests would have to fly in from out of state. Our friends and families are pretty much all over the country. 

I have also been thinking of ways to make things better or easier for guests who have to travel &amp; take time off such as having a welcome dinner on the Saturday before, providing Uber vouchers, etc. Any suggestions?",Sunday wedding advice?,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning

"Heads up: I'll probably miss details so if something doesn't make sense leave a Q and I'll reply with info!

So my future mother in law wants to host an after party for my partner and I, and I'm feeling really hesitant. Originally, she was planning for it to be right after the wedding reception, and we told her that's alright but we would have to decline attending because our wedding is a brunch wedding that wrapping up at 5pm, and my partner and I already planned to get a nice dinner and finish the evening celebrating quietly, the two of us. Now, she wants to hold the after party 2 weeks later. Am I the only one that feels it's weird?

I'm struggling to understand why she's so insistent on this after party, while other projects we've asked for help with (collecting In Memory photos, paying for my partner and the brother's suits, helping with the rehearsal dinner) have been met with some quiet pushback (mostly $ related). At first I thought she wanted the after party because:

1. Her extended family will be in town and more celebrations=more time together - This doesn't make as much sense if she waits two weeks to hold it?

2. I know I'll get a lot of flack for this, but there will be no alcohol at our wedding, so maybe she wants a party where she can drink with people to celebrate? She's a classic Wine Mom (no hate on her as a person, just who she is!) and it probably doesn't feel like a celebration to her without it.

3. She really likes to host big parties (she likes to invite almost everyone that's her friend on Facebook), so maybe she just wants to plan something, or feels like that's what she would want and thus must be something we would enjoy? - Only thing is, I'm afraid of a repeat of what happened when she hosted a college graduation party for my partner; invited tons of her friends, family, and coworkers and very few people that know my partner well, and it ended up being 85% New House Party (they had moved less than half a year prior) and 15% Grad Party (cards from some family members, and the friends my partner invited thankfully saved the day with some games in a quiet room to the side). 

Now with the two week delay, I'm even more confused. Originally, she mentioned that we could open our wedding gifts together at the after party, which I'm really not comfortable with - I've asked my partner to make it clear to her that won't happen. She also mentioned inviting extra people, like my partner's 3rd grade teacher (again, FB friends who occasionally comments on a picture she shares of my partner, she showed up for the HS grad party) and others who weren't invited to the big day. At the end of the day, we're planning the wedding and reception we want to celebrate, and we didn't plan the type of event she's thinking of because it's not what we wanted. I feel guilty about dreading this party and being ungrateful but I am just so lost on why she is insistent on this?

TLDR: Future MIL wants to host what I feel is a super awkward post-wedding party 2 weeks later. Am I crazy and mean? Any ideas on how to resolve this?",Am I crazy for feeling uncomfortable?

I had an affair in a very unhappy marriage and my husband found out. Last week he woke me up all hours of the night confronting me about the affair. I locked myself in our bedroom and he kicked the door down out of anger. I went to another room where our 5 yr old son was asleep. My husband purposely woke him up to tell him I was a lot of ugly things. I got really upset and scratched his neck trying to pull him out and away from the room where our son was now awake. I then called 911 because he was still verbally assaulting me with our son in the room. When the police arrived and I told them what happened my husband refused to speak to the cops ‚Äúwithout a lawyer‚Äù until the police said they were going to arrest me because I had physically assaulted him. I was in jail for a day and charged with a class A misdemeanor of domestic violence and an emergency protective order was placed for him and my son for 30 days. After speaking to a lawyer they informed me that my husband could easily request full custody of our son instead of joint custody when filing for divorce. This is not the news I wanted to hear as he is emotionally and mentally abusive and I have multiple character witnesses who can support this. He would also force me to have sex throughout our whole marriage but I never reported it. My questions are, is it almost positive that he can easily win full custody if we go to trial and if I report him sexually abusing me would it help in my favor to gain ground in having joint custody? I was told the charges against me could be used against me even if I‚Äôm found not guilty.

We've booked our wedding for next October 2023 (yay!!) so we are now working to book our vendors and that starts with a month of Coordinator! I love planning but will definitely need some help in the weeks leading up to the big day and on the actual day of the wedding. 

Looking for advice on what to ask and what to look out for,  and what to avoid as we screen potential coordinators.

I'd say we are pretty simple clients - we are skipping the wedding party (only our parents will be in the ceremony procession). We will have a photographer and videographer and DJ for music. The food/drink is all provided by the venue.. rentals are provided by the venue as well. We will also have the venue coordinator present to oversee food/drink and venue set up/take down. 

We are bringing our own decor, so no florist to coordinate with either. I mostly just need someone to keep things moving smoothly, and an extra set of hands for set up and take down of our decor.

"We‚Äôve been married for 6.5 years, together for 16.5 years and I just want it to be over. We came together during a very lonely time in both of our lives. I was so young and insecure. Next thing I knew we were living together, and then I was pregnant. That was within the first 3 months. It soon became apparent that he had a drinking problem. He was constantly blowing money we didn‚Äôt have drinking at bar. It was also pretty obvious there was a lot of questionable behavior. There were a couple times that I thought I had almost enough to know he was cheating for sure but he always downplayed and denied. He treated me like I was jealous and crazy for being so suspicious. 

Fast forward to about a year after we were married, 6 months after we bought a house and it all came out. He had cheated on me. He‚Äôd been cheating on me on and off for 10 years. This revelation completely broke me open. But I didn‚Äôt leave. I spent the next 5 years spiraling. First desperately trying to save our marriage. Then retreating into myself, becoming an angry and bitter woman, and not caring for my mental, emotional or physical health. I just didn‚Äôt want to deal with him or life anymore. 

Through all this he just wanted me to forgive him and not talk about it anymore. And he continued to drink. I‚Äôve been in therapy for the last year, and attending al-anon meetings sporadically. I just don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. I don‚Äôt care to try at all. I used to beg him to do things with me, watch movies, take walks, come to bed instead of falling asleep on the couch every night, talk. But I can‚Äôt anymore.

Despite feeling this way for months now, I‚Äôm struggling so deeply. I‚Äôm scared that our children will be so hurt if we divorce. He and I tried to create a stable home for our kids, something we never had.  I just worry that it will be like I pulled the rug out from under them.

"If you feel great about your wedding and don't have any guilt/regret associated to any part of it, that's wonderful and I'm genuinely happy for you! But I know I definitely have some guilt and I've seen other posts/talked to other brides/grooms and it seems like a lot of us do have some guilt associated to our wedding. So I wanted to create a post ""safe space"" for us all to express our guilt without feeling bad or worried about being judged. 

On that note - PLEASE DO NOT POST JUDGEMENTAL remarks here. I know that's basically part of this sub's rules to begin with, but I just want to reiterate it now.

I'll start with a few of the things I'm feeling guilty about, and I preface these by saying I do not judge others for these things so please don't let me make you feel guilty either!

1. I feel guilty about spending so much money on a wedding that isn't even what I really want. Like, I'm okay with what we're doing, but this is far from my ""dream wedding"" or even ideal wedding experience, and I feel guilty about having thoughts of ""I would have preferred to have the wedding at that venue"", ""I'm sad we won't have an over the top wedding cake, but know that a dessert table is better for our particular guest list"", ""I wish I could have had this other dress, but it was way out of budget/I couldn't try it on nearby"", ""I wish covid weren't around so my girls and I felt more comfortable having a bachelorette spa day"", ""If only these decorations were in our budget"", ""I want someone to throw me a bridal shower but that's more expenses and we already have what we need and it's bad enough we're already asking for gifts for our wedding"", etc.
2. I feel guilty for having taken up bridal consultants' time at stores while I was floundering. I felt bad about wanting to try on so many dresses, especially when they were so different, I was concerned they thought I was just trying to have fun, but really I was just trying to be efficient. I feel bad for going back to stores a second time and still having not bought my dress from there.
3. I feel guilty about talking about my wedding with basically everyone except my fianc√©. I don't like being the center of attention and I don't want to make my friends and family feel like I think I'm the only one that matters and that I'm special because I'm getting married. But at the same time, I AM supposed to get a bit more attention right now, right? This is a thing we should be celebrating? I should be able to talk about my wedding because it's kind of a big part of my life right now. My personality though just makes me squirm about it.
4. I feel guilty about skimping on some things here and there to save costs, but also feel guilty when we spend more on other things because it's like ""Did we really need \*that\* photographer/decoration/menu item/etc?""",Safe Space: What do you feel guilty about regarding your wedding?,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning

Typically what happens is I get slightly upset about something, and don't say anything because I don't want to raise a fuss. She pretty much ignores any subtleties with me and goes about her life worrying about her own needs. Usually I feel pretty invisible in these states. 

Then when it finally boils over, we usually have a fight. And that fight usually involves me dumping a lot of emotional feelings on her. And she feels like it came out of left field. To me, it's been boiling for weeks, sometimes months. 

I figured the root cause of the issue is she has a lack of interest in putting in effort in our relationship. And that's fine, but I feel like I'm putting in all the effort. If I wanted an independent life like that, quite frankly, I wouldn't have a wife. I try to please her when she asks for something. I ask about how she's doing and try to make her feel better. In short, I try to understand her without her telling me. And sometimes I feel like she doesn't try to understand me at all, unless I raise a fuss and be ""dramatic"" for lack of a better word.

"My wife &amp; I are trying to get an amicable divorce. The only problem, currently, is the car. She can‚Äôt afford it by herself and I don‚Äôt even drive. I am trying to be as supportive as possible without hurting myself, as she‚Äôs the one who wanted the divorce. 

A few options we have (or have thought about and won‚Äôt work):

1) She could keep the car and be living terribly until she can find a way to get rid of it. 

2) We could sell the car (at a loss) and get a loan to pay off the rest. This is not currently feasible as we haven‚Äôt been approved for a loan.

3) We could trade in the car for a less expensive vehicle and roll over the remainder and I could pay that portion. 

I am trying to be fair and, whilst #3 seems like a good option, it also seems that I could be paying on her car for years to come which I would rather not do.

"Maybe I have no right to be upset about the situation but I still feel like ranting. Let me know if this isn't the right spot.

One of my husband's childhood friend is getting married this year and has asked my husband to be a groomsmen last year. Husband was super excited, said yes, and has been bragging to me about it since then lol (I was happy for him, I could tell he was genuinely excited).

The groom and bride to-be have been planning a bachelor(ette) party (that will also have non-bridal party folks as well) since the end of last year and they finalized something at the beginning of this year. It's a weekend out of state. We each paid the first deposit last year and then a second deposit just last month. Each deposit was given because we received communication from the couple about how much we owe and all that (that would be sent to everyone in the group, it's not like we were stiffing them).

My husband and I went to another wedding late last month (after the 2nd deposit and after buying plane tickets to get to that state) and that just made us realize that we never received any information about the groomsmen outfit rentals. I told my husband to reach out to the groom to make sure we didn't miss anything. My husband texted him and a couple of minutes later his face absolutely fell.

Turns out the groom had to remove someone from his party due to counting issues and it was my husband.

&amp;#x200B;

I totally get it. Things happen. But to not get the courtesy to let us know that he's no longer in the party ... I feel like that was done on purpose so we can pay off our room. I don't think we would have gone to this bachelor(ette) party if my husband wasn't a groomsmen in the first place.

"Self explanatory title.

However we are a bit stumped on how to handle speeches, anyone have any experience with multicultural weddings?  

We are leaning towards maybe having no speeches at all, and maybe writing personal notes for each guest in their native languages to leave at their place settings. Or maybe just a thank you speech from both of us one in English and one in Spanish? Would it be rude to skip the family speeches altogether?

Are there any general/common estimates or some kind of template for this form? In some cases, I just have no idea what a typical monthly expense would be for a certain category.

"My fiance &amp; I are thinking of doing a combined father/daughter &amp; mother/son dance, and I am stuck on ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" by Guns N' Roses being the song we use. My soon-to-be mother-in-law absolutely loves the idea. I haven't brought it up to my dad, as he is the type, if I do not have a song that I 100% want, he will start suggesting his own song ideas. My issue is, how does one dance to Sweet Child O' Mine???? I cannot dance whatsoever, &amp; that isn't really a song you can do an easy slow dance to! I have searched and searched for different versions of ""Sweet Child O' Mine"", &amp; have found many that sound great, however none of them are standing out as ""THE ONE"". These are the two I've found, that are top choice, &amp; what I do &amp; do not like about them. (These can be found on YouTube)

Sweet Child O' Mine (Piano Cover by Jake Coco) - Absolutely beautiful played on piano! Love that it is a shorter, condensed version of the song, as the thought of dancing with my dad for a long time in front of everyone makes me feel like having a panic attack! My only issues - it is almost TOO slow?? Maybe I just am too stuck on the sound of Axl Rose's voice??

Sweet Child O' Mine (Piano &amp; Cello Cover) The Piano Guys - OH MY GOD, the sound of this is PURE peace &amp; tranquility &amp; absolutely one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard! Issue - it is purely instrumental. I love it so much, but I love those lyrics more! But god, if this isn't the most beautiful thing I've ever heard! Will definitely have to listen to more by these guys! If this had actual singing of the song in it, it would be a done choice!

"I'm extremely grateful to have found this sub in the past few weeks and I've power-read it this past 24 hours. Yesterday my husband and partner of 12 years finally admitted that he was unhappy in this marriage and that his feelings for me had changed, that he was unable to give me what I needed emotionally making us both unhappy. This comes after 2 miserable months where I could feel he was emotionally checked out and me asking for intimacy and an emotional connection that he was unable to give me. He claims that my timeline of 2 months fits his and that this is a recent development but this comes after 2 brutal years of personal traumas for the both of us, losing a sibling, losing a parent, losing a job, moving cross country, and of course, covid. Part of me feels like this is no time to make such a huge decision given the turmoil we're coming out of but another part of me is just emotionally exhausted and can't fight the good fight anymore. I love this man and while I have been in this relationship for the entire time, he has in the past had a tendency to ""check out"" emotionally every now and again. That was usually part of bouts of his severe depression which neither of us thinks is the case now. I feel like 2 months of disconnect is not enough time to abandon 12 years of us but right now, I just don't have the energy to try to fix anything, and when he came out with it yesterday, saying everything but the words themselves: ""I don't love you anymore"" it was a strange relief. We're now officially taking time apart but I've told him that my instinct right now is just to let go and see what happens. I'm super calm and collected, it's friendly and amicable but he seems way more broken up about this than I am.

"Hi all‚Ä¶ Not looking for legal advice here, just advice advice‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs a long story (aren‚Äôt they all?), but I‚Äôll try to go fast: my wife (51F) and I (50M) have been together for 21 years, married for 18. Two kids in Elementary school. Living in California. 

Cracks started forming 10 years ago, leading to me developing a drinking problem and an inappropriate friendship with an ex. Led to a one night hook up which I lied to cover up, then more drinking, which I also attempted to hide through more lying, crossing over into gaslighting. I was a completely selfish jackass who couldn‚Äôt stop digging deeper for a while there. 

We spent years trying to heal, going to couples and individual counseling, followed by years of status quo, followed by the pandemic, of course. I tried my best but still messed up occasionally (although never again with the cheating). Ultimately, my wife never forgave me, and now has come forward saying she‚Äôs had a romantic tryst of her own (now over, she claims) and wants a divorce. No more trying, no more hoping for better, just accept it for what it is and move on. 

I‚Äôm equal parts understanding, devastated, ashamed, and terrified.  But all of that is just setup for my question. 

Am I crazy for thinking that she should be the one to move out? It‚Äôs clear she was assuming that I‚Äôd be the one to park my bags and find an apartment, and when I pushed back on that, her first response was to walk back her initial offer of an amicable, lawyer-free process. 

My reasoning is: yes, I‚Äôm the one who messed up first, but I‚Äôm also still desperately wanting to salvage what we have. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúdone‚Äù with her - but she‚Äôs clearly done with me and wants to leave. 

The thought of leaving my home and my family when I‚Äôm not the one who wants to end it makes me sick. But the threat of wasting who-knows-how-many thousands of dollars of our kids‚Äô college funds on lawyers fees makes me sick too‚Ä¶

Am I just being immature and/or continuing my selfish ways? Clearly somebody needs to be the one, and it‚Äôs going to devastate our kids either way. So maybe: why does it matter?

Anyway‚Ä¶maybe I should have gone with the ‚Äúrant‚Äù flair after all, but I honestly am looking for a different, objective perspective on this.

"I am getting married next April, but we booked our venue last year and our venue is booked for the whole weekend and has accommodation on site for close friends and family. my bridal party knew this and liked the idea and knew they would have to pay for their rooms overnight, the venue is in the same county but is quite remote, so most people will need accommodation nearby. 

Yesterday my maid of honour said she couldn't afford to stay at the venue and asked if I'd mind if she stayed off site (about half an hour drive away). i want her to stay on site, it would feel like her time with us was limited to taxis etc, also the rest of my bridal party is staying, and I'd be worried about her being late also because she pretty much always is late. I've paid for her outfit for the wedding in full, and am not expecting her to make any other financial contributions other than her stay, so I feel a bit annoyed that she would ask? I said to her that I'd like her to stay (didn't make any comment about how I'm not expecting much else from her financially) but said if they really can't afford it then I understand but if they were really hard up close to the wedding I could help. she said she would stay and just pay but it's left a bit of a sour taste and im worried i guilted her into making a commitment she cant fulfill! mostly just venting, am I being unreasonable in feeling a bit hurt? does it sound like I pressured?

"orry, messed up with the input. Backstory is we've been married 2 years, known eachother for 8. We had an argument Wednesday, didn't go well said mean names to hear (which I instantly apologized... was because I was literally pushed to my limit and intentional things were being said though my action is still unacceptable). 

She called today while I was at my parents house for the night and said she wants a divorce. She's thrown this word around for awhile now, on and off. Sometimes are great others are very difficult. My hobbies include working on cars, socializing. Mountain biking, sports, etc. Hers are gardening, cooking, reading, also studying Buddhism. (Reading books). I fully support everything she does. I never ask her to change her interests. I have a 1970 chevelle and have had for over 10 years. Completely rebuilt and my pride and joy. She wants me to sell it. She kept saying sell the car... sell the car just off the principle. She literally said she will not move on until the car is sold. 

Later understood the issue was because I spend too much time working on the car, when in reality it's not much anymore. Maybe oil changes and fixing things here and there. She doesn't feel like I give her enough attention. She feels alone. She has broken up with me in the past about 6 years ago while dating, similar type of situation but after 3 weeks we worked it out. We have a cat and share rent month to month. Cumulative we make about 170k. I can afford my rent of $2850 mo, but will be interesting. 

She said she is ready to move on and wants to file. For some reason every time she goes home to her parents... every time after a fight this happens. She doesn't have any other close friends besides her parents. Only them.I love her and will make the necessary changes to move the car from the house to parents house so it's out of sight. Well do more things together including cooking classes and such which she recently stated she would like.

"I've posted snippets of my wife's behavior over the last ten ish years. It's been abusive (I've been told, I have this weird problem where I just feel like I deserve everything and should forgive her... Something for another post)

Last Monday night she asked me into our daughters room to talk privately. She wanted me to drop the divorce,  because it's not her fault. She was in pain and it's not fair for me to hold her behavior against her. She said she would kill herself if I didn't drop it. I started to try to get her to the ER, and when I refused to back down, she pulled a mostly full bottle of prescription anxiety meds from under the pillow, threw them all back, and started chugging bourbon to wash them down. She then went to lay down with our daughter til she died. I called 911, got the bottle of bourbon away from her, tried to get the backup bottle of wine away, all while holding our month and a half year old son. EMS was able to convince her to go to the ER, where she was transferred to a psych ward on a 72 hour hold. 

She called incessantly during the hold. Trying to tell me how everything would be fine if I just gave in essentially. How she's changed and stuff. She came back home Friday, refuses to stay away even though CPS wants her to. She's managed to get our provisional hearing postponed for over a month, so I haven't been able to get a court order to get her out of the house. I haven't known peace outside the times the hospital turns the phones off.

I think this is fucking with my head. Like, I watched someone try to die and am just supposed to act like it was no big deal. She wants me to give her time to complete intense therapy. I feel guilty as fuck not backing down. Part of me is screaming to drop everything. Anyone experience this weird feeling of like denial? Like I've blown stuff out of proportion or something. Does it get easier? Am I still giving grace when I should know better?

"TLDR/BLUF:  Do I contribute what I'm most comfortable with, even though I know it's barely a drop in the bucket, or do I go ahead and splurge a bit and kick in a bit more than I'd prefer (I can afford to, but I'd rather keep that money where it is, to be honest)

I am struggling with determining how much I should contribute to my son's wedding costs.  A little background....I'm a 67-year old single Mom of 2 adult sons.  One is finally (ha) getting married and I am delighted!  He and his father (we've been divorced for 30 years) had a major falling out a few years ago and, consequently, his father is not attending or participating in the wedding.  I'm fine with that, but it does affect the financial contribution from the groom's side....which means only me.  I am not a wealthy woman, though I have been diligent in saving and preparing for my retirement.  I'm not rich, but nor am I poor.  I live within my means and do so comfortably, but I'm not a big spender as a general rule.  My soon-to-be daughter-in-law's family, on the other hand, is very well off and the upcoming wedding and all associated events (rehearsal dinner, photographer, flowers, etc., etc.) will have a total price tag that I can't even begin to imagine.  So, here's my dilemma.  Any time I've brought up in conversations with my son the topic of how much I should plan to contribute (I live on the opposite side of the country from everyone else, so I'm not physically present to gauge expenses), my question is never really answered.  I know he's trying to ensure that I don't worry about it and that there are no expectations from me, but I most definitely WANT to contribute....I just want to do it right.  I haven't directly raised it with the bride's parents yet; I felt that might be awkward in email and I plan to speak with them in person about it when we get together in advance of the wedding.  I love my soon-to-be DIL and I like her family very much, so that's all good.  I just don't have any idea how much money I should propose as my contribution.  I don't want to over-burden myself, but I don't want to be a cheap-skate, either.  I would be most comfortable giving the bride and groom a wedding gift of $1000 and writing the bride's parents a check for $3000, but I know that this amount doesn't even cover the rehearsal dinner they've planned.  So, if nobody wants to actually give me a dollar amount (they're all trying to be thoughtful and kind to me, it's clear), but I know full well that this wedding is going to be $$$$$, what do I do?  Offer what I'm most comfortable with or kick in an extra 6K or so?  To be clear, I do have the money and it would not deplete my savings; I'd be fine financially if I kick in more than what I'd prefer.  I just mentally have a hard time with it all because having such a costly wedding is not my style at all....but it's THEIR wedding, not mine, and they should have the kind of wedding they wish to have.

We have not been doing well for while and honestly I was just working up the courage to say the words ""I want a divorce"" when after pleading with me to make this work, he filed himself and only told me after the fact. 

He had become very controlling, manipulative, and coercive. Neither of us are innocent in this, as every issues has two sides, but he did and said so many things that I just don't know how to come back from. We have two young children and I do not want them to grow up like that. 

So, my question is how and when did you tell people about your divorce?

"I met my wife march 2020 , she got pregnant on Dec 2020 and we moved in Jan 2021 and got married August 2021. She already had a 4 year old daughter, we had our baby she‚Äôs 6 months now and my wife is also pregnant now (accidental) 

Basically We rushed this shit man. There‚Äôs really so much I could type, but the bottom line is we are not gonna work out. We are both 22 and realize that we don‚Äôt really like eachother all that much. There‚Äôs been constant fights since the second we moved in together. There‚Äôs been so much shit said and done. 

There‚Äôs really no way this can be nor do we want it to be fixed. My biggest regret is her being pregnant again. She constantly insults me, calls me name‚Äôs etc, she‚Äôs not willing to work or try and fix anything for the kids and quite frankly, even if she wanted to I don‚Äôt think that would be the beat idea.

"Hello,

My husband and I (legally married in 2020) are finally going to have our official ceremony and reception in June. The ceremony is at 2:30 at our church (ending at 3:30), and the reception will be at 4:30 in my parents‚Äô backyard. We are preparing for 90 guests, but assuming a fair amount will decline.

We will be renting furniture and linens, having a bartender, having a mobile pizza oven caterer, and flowers, a cake, and possibly cold appetizer trays from another caterer being delivered. We will have a photographer too, but they will be with us, of course.

Because there are so many moving parts that we will not be able to guide our vendors with on the day of the wedding, I feel that it would be worth it to hire a day-of-coordinator to assist in running things smoothly, and to create a timeline for when each vendor is showing up, where the furniture needs to go, where the flowers need to be, and heck, maybe even making sure that the cold appetizers are refrigerated! 

I‚Äôm trying to find someone fairly inexpensive ($1,000 or less; I‚Äôm in the Los Angeles area so things are bound to be pricey) because my husband and I have done a lot of the planning and found most of our vendors on our own. However, I understand that these coordinators are providing a valuable service and need to be paid. My mom, however, is horrified at the thought of paying someone more than $200 to do something ‚Äúa teenager could do‚Äù. (ugh)

I feel like having a professional around would help ease a lot of nerves, and minimize the amount of work we‚Äôd all need to do during the reception.

Honestly, I feel embarrassed that I even considered reconciliation after I found out who he truly was, and some of the other stuff from his past, but oh well, I figured it out eventually - and then I spent almost 2 months continuing to live with him  (in separate bedrooms) while figuring out finances and finding a rental.

"We separated in March of last year, and are waiting for a no fault divorce to be available in April (we are in the UK) 

We own a house, jointly, which I stayed in with our 2 kids. We have agreed that I will buy him out.

When we came to the conclusion that divorce was the way forward, I asked that he transfer the mortgage payments to our joint account (they currently come out of his personal account) so I can take them over. He agreed, but we are now two months later and he has gone back on this, saying that he doesn't trust me and he believes I have an ulterior motive in wanting to pay the mortgage myself. 

So I called the mortgage provider and changed the account myself, to my personal account. 

He is going to be very angry when he finds out. But financial control was a huge factor in our marriage and I'm just not comfortable trusting him with the roof over my head. 

I think him wanting to keep control of the mortgage, is his last ditch attempt to keep control of me, and have something to hold over my head. I also suspect that he is planning on trying to get more for the house because he has paid the mortgage this whole time (I only ever worked part time, as I was basically a stay at home mum and homemaker)

My parents divorced about 2 years ago. They bought a house together while my mom was unemployed about 2 years before the divorce. She got an email today from the mortgage company saying something about hardship request. Her ex husband the veteran has not been making payments on the house and apparently going to let it go into foreclosure since he moved to the other side of the country recently. The mortgage company is saying my mom is liable for the payments. When they divorced they did an uncontested divorce and her ex put on the paper that he will assume the house and debt. No court or attorneys involved. So basically what I'm getting at is would she be able to move back into the house and make payments on it so it won't go into foreclosure? She is not a veteran. I mean if she is legally liable to pay for it then why wouldn't she be allowed to LIVE in it and pay for it? He has cut off all communication since the divorce as well so don't know how she'd be able to get in contact with him for him to refinance the house to get her off the debt of the house.,VA home loan divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"My wife and I have been together since high school, and we have three kids. Our oldest is (hopefully) going to college in the fall, our middle is in high school, and our youngest is going into Kindergarten. We found out she was pregnant with our first when we were still in high school, and he was born as we were starting our first semester at college. We were together on and off throughout college, but neither of us ever dated anyone else, and we got married just before my last semester. 

She's told me she has tried so hard to make me happy over the years, and I recognize that, even if I didn't appreciate it at the time. I could say the same for her ‚Äî that I always tried to encourage her to do what she needed for her career or to go back to school to change her career. But I have dealt with depression on and off since childhood, although I only started treating it in earnest about 10 years ago. Even with therapy and medication, I've had my struggles. 

We bought a house when I got my first job out of college, since I thought I'd have that job for years to come, only to get laid off as the economy collapsed in late 2008. We ended up moving to a state where we didn't know anyone for several years for my career, and back to my childhood home after my mom died suddenly in 2013. Her death hit me very hard, and my wife told our therapist during one of our attempted counseling sessions that she definitely noticed a worsening of my depression after that which never really improved. 

Five years ago, we moved back into the house we bought 15 years ago, since we had our third on the way. And I think we came to the realization ‚Äî¬†or I did, anyway ‚Äî¬†that I'd been operating under the assumption that the next job, or the next move, would fix what was wrong. We were stressed and uncommunicative because we had young kids, or because my career and salary essentially stalled for 10 years, or because we were living in a small condo or apartment that cost too much to rent. After we moved back into the house, though, and I got a job with actual raises and promotions, things still weren't better. 

We've had conversations about separating or divorcing a few times over the last couple of years, but things really accelerated after my wife took a travel nursing job for six months in late 2020. I stayed home with our oldest, who was struggling to finish high school, while she took our youngest with her and our middle child to watch him while she worked. She and the kids flew back several times, and our oldest and I visited them for a week as well. It was on that trip that it really started to dawn on me that something had changed for her. She'd rented an apartment and set it up herself, which she was proud of, but there was also something missing emotionally. It's not like she was annoyed to see me or anything, but her reaction was cooler than I expected. I cried on the drive to the airport and had no idea why at the time. 

After she came home, I was still struggling with depression and ADHD with executive dysfunction, along with a job that was becoming much more stressful. We tried counseling, but she moved out in September. 

I took her out last week after the kids went to bed and tried to ask her what she wants. She told me she feels as though she bends over backwards to try and make me happy, but she feels like no one worries about what would make her happy. Our poor communication over the years was evidenced by both of us assuming ill intent with prior attempts to work things out. She accused me of sending emotional emails or texts when she had to take care of the kids or go to work, when I thought I was doing exactly the opposite. And I reacted badly after she told me it was inappropriate of me to text her late at night to say I was in a really bad place and felt entirely alone, because she took it as a veiled threat of suicide, when all I wanted was for my best friend of 20 years to tell me she knows this all sucks and she's sorry. 

By the end of the night, after we sobbed and held each other for a while, we came to the conclusion that it just isn't going to work. I don't want to formally divorce yet, because I would be forced to sell the house in that process, and I don't want to risk having to move away from our daughter's high school and make her switch schools with only two years left. She would be fine with letting me keep the house, but that's not an option here. 

At this point, though, I don't know what to do with myself. I'm 38 years old, and I'm losing the only woman I've ever been with and the only relationship I've ever known. I know I should take this as an opportunity for self-improvement ‚Äî go to the gym, fix up the house, get into my hobbies ‚Äî¬†but I don't even know what would make me happy at this point. I'm just alone and overwhelmed by it all. 

I'm also afraid of following in my father's footsteps. He divorced his first wife when my three siblings were fairly young, and he didn't share custody of them with their mom; he just visited them every couple of months to start, and after I was born, we only saw them a couple of times per year. After my mom died, he got into a new relationship within a few months, and now all his focus and energy is on his new family ‚Äî her kids and grandkids.

I don't know what I am without my wife and kids, and I'm scared to find out. My therapist keeps asking me, ""what would make *you* happy?,"" and I don't have an answer. The thought of dating or even just finding new hobbies just leaves me feeling guilty about the possibility of doing what my dad did and just becoming a whole different guy with a whole different personality, a guy who tries not to think too much about what he had before. 

Thank you to anyone who read through all of this rambling nonsense. I needed to write it down somewhere, not least because it looks like the therapist I was seeing through Teladoc canceled my appointment, and it won't let me schedule a new one.","It's over, but it's also just beginning, and I am so lost",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

This divorce happened about 37 years ago‚Ä¶They have only been in the same room like three times since then. My husbands high school and college graduation, and then our legal wedding ceremony. 

Jane still HATES Adam and Nancy. I‚Äôm not sure where the Nancy hate comes from since Adam didn‚Äôt even meet Nancy until a couple years after the divorce (has been confirmed). She has no shame in yelling about it time and time again, calling Nancy a cunt and just overall being incredibly unpleasant. Jane has some sort of mental illness which I assume just makes this all worse. I can get more into this background if need be. 

Nancy has been my husbands step mother since he was FIVE years old and he considers her to be a mother figure. 
We have not talked to any of the moms about this yet. We imagine Jane will be offended but we also think Nancy will be offended too if she‚Äôs asked to not wear a MOG dress. Nancy is easy going though and will probably tell us it‚Äôs fine no matter what we choose but we don‚Äôt want to make her sad. We both love Nancy and I honestly prefer to be around her over Jane. Jane caused us a lot of trouble over the years and she was especially a problem at our legal wedding by not showing up to the rehearsal, saying she wouldn‚Äôt show up to the wedding (bc of Adam and Nancy), and leaving early before dinner due to drunkenness when she did show up.

"I'm clueless. My mom has been facing verbal and sometimes even physical abuse from my dad ever since I remember. I've got some mental problems because of that too. Two days ago, he beat her up so bad (with fists to the head) I had to call 155 for aid, fortunately she's alright and didn't go to the hospital. It was because she borrowed a phone cable without asking. She consulted police and some more people and everyone said she should leave since the abuse escalates. She also has a record from the hospital she went the next day to check her wounds up.

My dad is a jerk, he said she deserved it because she took his stuff with a smirk on his face and even when we were trying to figure out if she's dying or not few and she was in pain (few minutes after the incidenr) he came and ordered her to go clean the kitchen.

He's away and I'm waiting for my mom to come so we can go live to my grandparents. However I'm in my room and I am so sad I have to leave all this. I lived here for 17 years afterall.

"I am in Maryland and (mistakenly) at the beginning of our separation , signed primary custody to my STBX in the Marital Separation Agreement at an every other weekend clip (besides an extra friday every month) because we had a verbal agreement that I would see my two kids before school and after school everyday, and in the summer as well since I worked remote and she did not. It meant we could both see them everyday instead of a stricter 50/50 schedule. We were getting along fine back then and working together.

Fast forward to now. She upheld this schedule for about 9-10 months. The last 2 months, she stopped bringing them to me or letting me pick them up to have them before school and same goes for after school. What was typically 3-4 hours of seeing them a day has dwindled to not seeing them for days at a time. Our relationship as co parents has deteriorated and its only seeming to get worse.

The MSA was signed and notarized but never submitted to court. I want more custody in the form of 50/50 ideally, or at least to have it in writing that I would have the opportunity to keep the status quo (before she changed it) on having the ability to see my kids everyday.

In about three days month 4 of separation will start. 

So far against other people‚Äôs advice I have told my ex if we could give it another shot once a month. 

Every time it is the same response and each month that response gets easier to handle. 

I wasn‚Äôt in a happy marriage. It only lasted three months, our relationship was a total of three years and we had problems going back to the beginning of our relationship. 

I feel like I have lost a lot; my house, dogs (I only got to keep one), wife, best friend, and most tragic of all myself. 

In these almost 4 months of ‚Äúsolitude‚Äù I have actually gained so much. 

-	I started therapy again. 
-	My mental health and physical health are improving every single day, and there are days I am the happiest I‚Äôve been in years. 
-	I am close to my family and friends again.
-	I got to keep Goku and having 1 single dog instead of 3 has allowed me to be less of a disciplinarian and more of a dad/best friend to my baby dog. 
-	I been on a lot of dates and there is one person in particular that is also going through a divorce that has been amazing. 
-	I decided that for my new years resolution, every single month I would do something epic. For the month of January I joined the gym and hip hop classes. In February I flew to Mexico city with family, got a bad ass DBZ tattoo by one of my favorite artist, and took some incredible photos at the teotihuacan pyramids. For March I went to Guadalajara, to see the Final Fantasy 7 world tour and it was incredible. I also had a date with a complete, amazing stranger in a brand new city. The photos are stunning thanks to her. 

Not going to lie, life has been amazing. Hard, emotionally difficult, but overall I am living again. 

The better I get though, the sadder I get too. The reason being, I know that if I was the person I am right now, that she wouldn‚Äôt have left. 

I was a recluse, filled with anxiety and depression that left everything and everyone behind. Not anymore though. 

I just wish she would or wanted to see this not so completely new person. 

I also wish that I could have shared these amazing moments with my wife. They been amazing regardless, but in my mind when I think back on these past 4 months. I plug her into those memories, her holding my hand while I do my tattoo, her walking with me in Mexico city. which means at least in my mind I am living two lives. Reality and fantasy. 

So my question is this; is this normal at 4 months. I feel like I should be on the complete acceptance part already instead of imagining a second life. 

And also is it normal to feel sadder, the better you do? 

And if this is normal how did you all get rid of those feelings. 

Thank you.",Month 4 of Separation - The better I do the sadder I get,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"I'm separated from my husband right now. He is staying with his parents. This past week was week one and we have a 4 and 2 year old and a dog. It was kind of an ordeal because my in laws don't want the dog at their house and also, it's just kind of alot of trudging around for the kids. 

I work 12 hour shifts and often back to back requiring me to stay at the hospital (about twice a week) 

I'm thinking about just saying my husband can come have his time with the kids at our house when I'm not there because, it seems simpler for the kids and I'm not there anyways. 

Thinking maybe only on school nights and if it's a weekend they can go to their grandparents with him. 

For context- I haven't filed for or even discussed divorce with him yet. I did meet with a lawyer. I pay all the bills for the house and well literally everything.

First 4 years of marriage I just choked up anticipating that she will improve or I will adapt or both will find a way. Couldn‚Äôt make any friends due to her nature of dominance and extreme possessiveness. My life sucked in home. Started losing interest in sex. Sex was just one way routine. And it finally stopped like no touch for 4 months, then 6 months. Love was clearly fading. But I was afraid to face it. Then in some weird moment Kids happened in 2014... I thought that having kids life will he different now and it will improve. But she started making use of kids to dominate me over simplest of the things, asked me to cut off any connection with friends, obliterate social life. Often she would threaten me to do suicide with kids if I don‚Äôt agree with her on absolutely anything. I Suffered mental trauma. Sex in us completely vanished. Haven‚Äôt touched her since year 2015. Then I couldn‚Äôt hold on. And at one moment in 2017 I started stop giving a fuck to her intimidations. I registered complaint with police but I didn‚Äôt inform her initially neither I made her appear there. It was just for my safety. Few weeks later I told her calmly to stop intimidating tactics and informed her that I have registered complaint in station. Threats of suicide stopped suddenly. 

And then In same year I met another girl and fell in love. I knew I was heading towards extra marital affair and that was because of broken marriage. I needed a peace and someone I can love to. 
She suspected it. I confronted her that I no longer can stay with you , let‚Äôs separate and keep respect of each other. But she again threatened to do suicide. I couldn‚Äôt move on.

"I'm confused y'all. I hope this is the place to post this. I'm asking for your perspective, especially if you yourself are a bride. 

For context, the bridal party members are all in their 20s. I think we all make about the same which is between 40k to 70k a year and we live in an expensive city so no one is rolling in money afaik.

I started dating a guy last summer and his sister got engaged around New Year's Day. Her wedding is in July, which seemed like a very short timeline for wedding planning but maybe not impossible. I tend to lurk in these wedding planning subreddits and watch stuff like Say Yes to the Dress so I like to look into wedding planning stuff a lot--or at least in theory lol. I've never done any actual planning.

Anyways when she asked for help with going to wedding expos and talking to vendors, I told her I'd be happy to help. I don't know her too well--I've met with her less than a dozen times mostly when I've shown up for family events. She's very sweet, she invited me to her birthday party, and we talk every now and then on Instagram. I got the feeling she was trying to be friendly with me since she'd close to her brother so I decided to make the effort too. 

Anyways, I bring all that up because much to my surprise she kind of sprung it on me that I was a bridesmaid. We were talking to a vendor at one of the wedding expo and she introduced me as one of her bridesmaids. The vendor started cracking up when she saw my face--I genuinely didn't know I was being considered until that moment. I was just hoping to get invited lol. 

I knew the wedding budget was 10k for 80 people. That seemed a little tight in terms of money and even the wedding planners I spoke to at the expos agreed. Not impossible but the bride and her groom had a lot of specifications for the wedding so it sort of complicated things. 

Because the budget was that small, I figured it was certain that I'd be buying the bridesmaid dress. This sort of bummed me out because I'm a short person. I have a formal gown I really like that I've had tailored to my size so I was hoping to be able to reuse that as a wedding guest. When the bride said we could pick our own dresses, I did run the dress by her and she said the color was too dark for a summer wedding. (Navy. Although it ended up being the groomsmen colors so....I guess just too dark for the women's side which is fair). I accepted it and asked her for a color palette so I could start looking. She said she needed help with that so I sent her everything that I could find with summer wedding color schemes. She thanked me and said she'd look at them later.

Then weeks pass and I don't hear a thing. Again, from being part of the subreddit and stuff I thought we'd go see vendor sites with her or help pick out the dress and stuff but she's only been taking her step mom. No one has seen her wedding dress or the venue. About three weeks ago she created the bridesmaid chat and said she had a dress she wanted us to try. I was immediately confused. She had told me we would be picking our own dresses which I thought was thoughtful for our budget and the fact that her bridesmaids all have different body types. Why she changed her mind, I don't know. My boyfriend thinks the step mom had heavy opinions on the matter. 

She sent us a picture of the dress. It's...okay. I not only don't like it too much (I'm not sure how its going to look on my body since I never wear off-the-shoulder. My boobs don't cooperate) but its also a little expensive. I said nothing because its *somewhat* within my price range but she was excited for us to try it. I thought it was a little strange that we hadn't gone with her to look for the bridesmaid dresses at all. Is that common? I don't know when she saw it or when she decided on it. As conversation continued it became abundantly clear that she wants us in that dress. We're not just trying it on today to see if its good, we're trying it on and buying it. She's also emphasized that if we go in today and buy the dresses in bulk the store will give us a discount and her some additional benefits. So we're not going to any other stores either. Whatever they've offered her, she likes. 

I reached out to her to clarify that we would be paying for the bridesmaid dresses ourselves. She said unfortunately yes because her budget is really tight. I told her it's not a problem for me to buy the dress I was just a little worried about the tailoring costs but I promised her I'd redo my budget to account for as much as possible and keep her posted. She thanked me and told me I could always come to her. For the appointment she just said today bring the shoes you want to wear to the wedding so we can do the tailoring accordingly.

Then last night one of the bridesmaids asked about shoe colors. The bride said she hasn't decided yet but she's been thinking on it and will let us know. And just. Hold up. We have to have matching shoe colors? The gowns are floor length--no ones really gonna get more than a glimpse of our shoes. And not only did we not have any input on a bridesmaid dress we have to pay for, and we'll likely have to pay for the makeup stylist to do our makeup too (she keeps hinting without outright saying it), but now I might have to buy matching shoes? I said in the group chat I only have black shoes but I'm afraid to outright say ""and I'm not buying new ones."" I feel weirdly combative and I don't want to bring it up until she says something. 

I'm just super confused. Is this how it goes? Brides don't ask for your input and definitely don't ask for your budget? Is it really okay to assume we'll drop whatever money she wants us to spend because we said yes to being bridesmaids? This is my first wedding ever and I always heard horror stories about bring a bridesmaid so this isn't the worst thing in existence, but I just thought she'd be more pragmatic about the money thing. She's being very money conscious about her budget which is smart, but what about us? To top it off, while I do want to be honest, I feel like this would be easier if we were close friends. I would have zero issue telling my best friend hey I can't afford it or hey maybe we should pick out the bridesmaid dress together. But with this bride, since we rarely talk it's like she's just throwing stuff at me without a chance to give input. I feel so awkward.

I guess I'm just asking--am I being rude? I don't want to think that I'll have to back out of being a bridesmaid dress if it turns out that I can't afford all the expenses, but if I have to do that, is it okay? 

I don't know. I just wish she'd asked us for our budget and told us from the onset what the expectations were. It would have at least ensured I wasnt caught off guard constantly.

"Hello. I have been in a very long and drawn out divorce. Started pre Covid and have another year till trial date. It has been drawn out not for the reasons you would typically think. My ex has not been able to keep a stable residence or employment for more than a month or two for the last 3 years. My ex has lied every time about moving denying it at all costs which has made service of court papers near impossible. So far my ex has lived in 4 states since the start of all of this. There is no assets or financial reason to cause this to be drawn out. All property has been in my name prior to marriage, ex was never added to any property nor were bank accounts ever combined.

"We're considering divorce and seems likely.

Well both be fine day to day. Not worried at all even with a small child splitting time.

My BIGGEST worry is after selling our house and splitting profit (maybe 50k each) I'm worried I'll never be able to afford a house in our area alone. Especially as prices sky rocketed in just a few years. I DON'T want a small condo, I'd rather rent and not be tied down with that type of asset.

I guess my question is are other singles in their mid 30s sitting on a similar Cash amount to get a house?

"Hey Wedditors. My dress just came in the mail and I am super excited! This is a budget dress for my microwedding from jjshouse and I can't be more pleased with how it came out.

"We bought our home in a highly competitive market in California.  However, we bought over five years ago.  In that time, our home value tripled in price.  Neither one of us had the money to buy the other person out, so we sold it.  Before selling, I begged to find a way to hold onto it together, after the divorce.  Use it as a rental.  Add a guest house in the backyard and I would live there, while she could have the entire main house to herself.

She barely ever considered any of my suggestions.  Always just said nope with a smirk.  She was totally done with me, and had to have her own space.

We sold the house and made good money.  She was so excited to get her half, but I was crushed.  I knew that we had just lost our most valuable asset.  The value of house was more than all of our other assets combined.  We are in our 50's - if we had kept the house for another 15 years, it would have given us a very nice retirement. 

Now, we each rent.  We are priced out of the the housing market, likely forever.  Our combined rents are more than double what our mortgage used to be. 

It feels like we literally fell down the socioeconomic ladder.  Yes, we each have cash, but our beautiful house is gone, and unless we move to a different state , we are probably lifelong renters. 

I remember the smirk on my wife's face as she said no to all my suggestions.  I'm not even sure she recognizes the loss.  That house would have bankrolled us for life.",My ex-wife's pride ruined us financially,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"Three of my friends, my mom, and I are going to New Orleans for my bachelorette party. I, apparently foolishly, mentioned it at Easter since we had just officially booked the air bnb and flights last Friday so I was excited about it. 

My aunt mentioned something about going at the same time and that it's a big city so we can't stop her. Because she ""wants to go too."" My cousin and I both said something like ""you could also go literally any other time"" But it was like mid several conversations and she didn't really bring it up again or respond to our suggestion.

The issue is my aunt has very different, and loud, political opinions than the rest of us going. She seriously can't keep her mouth shut about it. It would be one thing if she was respectful and could just keep her opinions to herself, as we do. It's seriously like anything will turn political with her. She even brought it up at Easter bc someone mentioned someone being old during dinner, and she goes ""you know who's old is Biden. He doesn't have any of his faculties anymore"" It's that constant. 

I don't believe for one second that even if I ask her to not bring up politics that she'll respect that, since I've never been paid that respect by her in the past. I'm used to it and choose not to engage with her, but my mom and at least one of my friends would not be comfortable holding their tongues around her. I don't want everyone in the group to be uncomfortable because of her. 

I'm hoping I didn't mention, or that she forgot, the dates. I can't remember if I did or not. What do I even say to her if she asks about it or says she's decided to come?

"No, this is not me.  My child is not going to the wedding, and I‚Äôm married.  It‚Äôs a coworker who has asked this question. Coworker is Megan and mutual friend is Gail.  Fake names.

Gail is getting married (Megan and I used to work with this person until she got a new job last year).  Megan has a 4 year old whose dad has never been in the picture.  

Megan has told me she asked Gail if her daughter (Ann) can wear a white dress she wore as a flower girl at her brother‚Äôs wedding.  Gail said no.  Megan said she cannot afford another dress for Ann and it‚Äôs the nicest one she has.  Gail has still said no.  Megan asked if Gail can help pay for a new dress for Ann.  Gail said no.

If it matters, because I know someone will ask, Gail‚Äôs family is basically loaded and they‚Äôre paying for the entire wedding.  To give you an idea, Gail‚Äôs dress alone cost $4500 before alterations.  I only know because someone asked her how much it was because it was so pretty (and it is, like I can barely afford to even look at it, that‚Äôs how pretty it is).  Gail is usually quiet about her family‚Äôs money in terms of talking about it, but everyone knows she has a lot based tangible things.  I disagree with Megan‚Äôs even asking for the bride to help pay for her daughter‚Äôs dress, but that‚Äôs why she asked.

Megan‚Äôs grand master plan is to show up with Ann in the white dress anyway because she doesn‚Äôt think Gail will say anything.

I think this is a bad idea because Gail is on the spectrum and has a thing will coordination and following rules.  She is very black and white about everything.  Again, I know this because when we worked together, Gail volunteered this information so we knew she wasn‚Äôt purposely being difficult but because sometimes she doesn‚Äôt understand when it‚Äôs okay to be flexible.  Gail is never flexible about traditions, culture, or her basic religious beliefs.

I think this will -really- throw a wrench in Gail‚Äôs wedding and make her angry for two reasons: 1. Megan was already told no so she‚Äôs basically ignoring what the bride wants and 2. Being on the spectrum, it might make her more upset than the average regular smegular bride and she may not be able to handle it well.

I don‚Äôt know if I should tell Gail what Megan plans to do.  Gail is getting married in a few weeks.  Megan has asked me not to tell, so I feel like I‚Äôve been put in the middle of this.

So I‚Äôm here asking brides how you would react if someone did this to you and if you have any solutions to this.  If I post this on the relationship_advice sub, I know I won‚Äôt get very constructive answers.  

Should I tell Gail? Is there a solution for Megan?  All other colors are okay.  Megan cannot afford a babysitter (her words).  The dress code is formal wear.  Megan has also said she wants to go because she never goes anywhere nice out and this would be nice so she has no intention of not going.",Serious question for brides: what does a guest do if the bride doesn‚Äôt want anyone wearing white but a single mom can‚Äôt afford a new dress for her kid and the nicest dress her kid has is white?,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning
"Whenever I search for money-saving tips for caterers, I find people got discounts through their connections (not helpful) or solutions that our venue won't allow (like food trucks).

I've noticed that caterers are quoting $28-$35 per hour per person for their waitstaff. That's all well and good, but it brings up a few questions that I've started asking caterers to answer. I'm curious if anyone here has any thoughts/insight here, and/or perhaps you'll want to ask your caterers the same questions.

1. Are the staff employees or contractors?
2. Are the staff receiving the full hourly rate that you're charging me?
3. Is the gratuity paid in full to the staff?

At least in my opinion, caterers shouldn't be adding any profit margin in the staffing charges, so the staff should get the full amount I'm being charged. If they're using contractors, it is safe to say that at least the 3rd party is taking a cut of that hourly rate.

Then, let's say the staff are receiving the full $28-$35 per hour for their services. I think that's awesome, but it makes me feel like the assumed (often mandatory) 20% gratuity is, well, gratuitous. 

We tip our restaurant servers because their hourly rate is so low. If they're being paid $30 per hour, why should I tip 20% on top of that? Let me quickly say that I'm not suggesting I won't tip at all, but I'd rather tip the staff individually with cash and perhaps something more like 10% divided amongst them. Of course, if the caterer is taking a cut of the hourly rate, I'd tip 20% to ensure the staff are paid a living wage. However, I'm not sure I want to do business with a caterer that is taking a profit on the staffing charges and not paying their staff fairly. The caterers should instead charge a service fee for any admin costs or necessary margin.

TL;DR: If staff paid fairly, why tip so much? If staff not paid fairly, why use that caterer? Also, any tips to feed 100 people good food for less than $8K + 20%?",Tips for saving money on caterers?

"Here is the [imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/REQwOFn)  of several outfits I have put together for a frugal Chinese-American city hall wedding in spring. I want to wear a red dress. I've never done this kind of pinterest-y thing before and I do not consider myself fashionable at all, so feel free to give me any feedback or suggestions.

Season: Spring
Setting: City Hall


My body: 5'3""-5'4"", 115 lbs, 34B-ish, hourglass, round face from some angles and oval-er face from some angles.¬†My appearance is more cute and friendly than sexy.


Vibe: sweet, comfortable, warm, not overly complex - but I would like it if it had some kind of interesting design idea.


In case you guys have some other ideas (some people have been very generous and helpful with their ideas! Thank you!)
My ideal dress:

Color: red (should be a brighter red, not a burgundy red)
Length: prefer knee to tea length, but anything is open except for mini length (anything 34"" and under will be too short to be comfortable for me).¬†Sleeves: flexible, but prefer cap to short sleeves. I prefer to be more covered at the top


Fabric: prefer silk crepe, charmeuse/chiffon. Open to some lace but I don't love it because lace tends to be hard to alter and sometimes scratchy especially on the cheaper end. I also sort of feel like all-over lace designs can be slightly ""lazy"" / cliched designs, but I can definitely be convinced otherwise. I don't like scuba material.¬†


Overall style: I think A-line dresses fit my hourglass figure best, well but open to others.


Neckline: I prefer boat and scoopnecks actually but I am open to regular V necks too. Not that into cowl necks. I am nervous about halter necks because I feel like the halter style doesn't give great waist or boob definition while also sometimes making shoulders larger.¬†


*NO* strapless, no one-strap, no super deep V necks unless it is reasonably secure. No mermaid dress shapes. No drop waists. No off the shoulder stuff. It should ideally cover a normal bra although¬†I think my boobs are small enough that if I have to I can probably not wear a bra. My back and upper body should be reasonably well-covered


Budget: I am willing to pay for the right dress, but ideally $100 or less.


I am trying to be frugal as possible and the dress will get bonus points if I can wear it in other settings.


I have also made sure that the shoes I'm pairing are comfortable (lol a lot of them are from the brand Naturalizer) and shoes that I can possibly re-wear.


My partner has like only one blue tie lol so tie color suggestions are also welcome.",can you help me pick a springtime city hall wedding outfit?,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning

I hated leaving her at the day care and going to work. I wished I can stay home with her but financially it wasn‚Äôt possible. 3 years later came the second a beautiful boy. We discussed having me stay at home but my career has taken off and we just bought our first house. I wanted a house and a back yard for our kids. I asked him if he can get a better job. But then I was already making much more then him and he had the potential. Had a masters degree in computer engineering and the market was hot. But he refused he said liked his stable government job. They cannot fire him and he will have a pension for us to retire on.  Then no 3 came around. I had a new idea. We sell the house. We big a house that we can rent a walkout basement and I work a few hours a week and stay with the kids. So we did and when I asked about the rental he said no. He does not want strangers living in his house. The house was way more than we can afford. So to work I went off again. Work -home dinner dishes laundry weekend are for cleaning food shopping organizing for next week. I was sad all the time. I had no chance to spend time with the kids   I settled in mind for quality of quantity. And as my two girls and boy got older and more independent things got easier.  Then we lost my son in a terrible accident at 18. I was devastate. We were very close. I was depressed yet I got up went to work, cleaned the house did the food shopping.

"I've been struggling with this concept for over a year now and it's truly tearing me apart. For context: when I met my now husband, I was definitely SUPER attracted to him physically (he is a very handsome man) but truth be told, our sex life was never good from the beginning. I'd say lack of sexual chemistry overall. BUT he was such a good person, and treated me so well that I figured that was something we could work on/explore together.

Fast forward 4 years and over the last year, my OVERALL attraction to him has declined significantly. I even look at our wedding photos and look at him now and feel so confused? I felt very attracted to him on our wedding, and the years before that. Is it possible that emotional things/lack of connection in other areas can make someone PHYSICALLY less attractive? I mean, sure, he looks different 4 years ago than he does now (grew out his hair, gained a little weight.. but nothing that I would have thought would ever change my view of HIM)

But I look at him now and I don't feel that desire/sexual/physical attraction towards him. Is that a reason to divorce someone?

Before it's suggested: we are in couples therapy, tried sex therapy, open communication, I've been reading COUNTLESS articles/blogs/stories/podcasts about this. And ultimately I am just at a loss. It's like my body shuts down when we have sex and I feel near-repulsed. Which then makes me feel SO guilty. People have told me to think back about the thing that made me attracted to him in the first place, and I am doing EVERYTHING in my power to do that.. but it's not bringing the sexual attraction back.

"Hi Weddit, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 71 days away from the day! Husband and I are planning a cocktail hour + reception (we eloped) for memorial day weekend in florida (USD) to celebrate with friends and family. It's going to be 5 hours, including the cocktail hour. 

I just really need a gut check - what can we expect for turnout, am I budgeting enough, is the timeline of events ok? 

\*We will not have assigned seating due to the layout of the venue (2 floors) - main floor has limited seating and will be used for primarily dancing and socializing. There is a green space as well where we will have additional tables and corn hole setup.

\*\*The second floor contains most of the seating that inside/outside and split into multiple table sizes, so it's best for people to just claim a spot for their stuff and use this space for solely eating/resting. Once they're finished eating, they'll be announced to come back downstairs and we'll kick off speeches.

"Hello all! Had a quick question about the paperwork on getting divorced. My wife and I have been apart since the beginning of 2018. Paperwork has been filed and I was served (no surprises). It is NOT a contested divorce. There are no assets, debts, or parenting plans that need setup. However, since we've split, she had a kid with somebody else. She's not trying to claim me as the father or asking for child support or anything. Pretty much we both want this to be done and over with. I've already filled out the paperwork and sent it to the courthouse agreeing with everything. 

My question is this: even though she is not trying to claim me as the father, do I STILL need to file a Denial of Parentage? (I live in Washington State)

"I hope this is alright to post here, I am trying to stay factual:

Backstory:
My partner is currently going through a very messy divorce (on year three) with an absolute menace of an ex-wife; this is putting it lightly. The kind of torment, hardship, verbal abuse, physical abuse, financial abuse, emotional abuse, gaslighting, manipulation, and slander this woman has put him through during their marriage and throughout the divorce is honestly unbelievable. They have a four year old child together, shared 50/50, which is why she will be a part of my partner's life for at very least, the next decade.
As truly awful of a person as she is, I firmly believe that this is attributed from her innate narcissism, teenage trauma, unstable family dynamic growing up,  untreated postpartum depression, and potential bi-polar tendencies.
My partner is a wonderful person, who, amidst the kind of hardships and trauma on top of his ex that he has endured, should be in much worse shape, but he is kind and patient, and loves his son more than anything in this world.

The ex:
They have know each other since they were kids, but separated during their adolescent and early adult lives, only to meet again and try things out romantically.
As I mentioned, his ex-wife has bi-polar tendencies, where one day she is an absolute nightmare and clearly antagonizes my partner to get a rise out of him or to attempt to bring him down (usually in a very malicious way), and the next day she is meek and light-hearted, making light jokes about their time married and initialing small talk. Again, my partner understands that she might have some mental instability and can't fault her entirely. Because of this, he is nice to her when she is in a good mood and stays very accommodating to her (lends her money when she forgets her wallet for the umpteenth time, offers to drive to meet her halfway, offers to pick things up related to the child for her etc.)
The thing to realize in the situation is that she is only nice to him when she thinks she has the upper hand or she is struggling financially and thinks she can coax him into giving her more money. Every single time, without missing a beat, she turns around and does something awful to him. She has lied and been uncooperative the entire way through the divorce and it breaks my heart to see my partner being robbed of precious time with his son and have his anxiety constantly being spiked.

Me:
We've been dating throughout this entire period, and I trust him unequivocally. The marriage clearly fell apart long before they decided to separate, and my partner has openly expressed that this is the healthiest relationship he's ever been in. I feel the same way. I did my best in the beginning to give his ex-wife the benefit of the doubt (after all, there are always two sides to the story), but her actions are reprehensible and unforgivable. I feel sick to my stomach every time she acts nicely towards him and he reciprocates, because I just know something terrible is going to happen.
I feel anxious, uncomfortable, and upset every time he is generous or accommodating to her, not out of any jealousy, but because I feel nauseated that she has done the kind of things that she has to him and has no remorse for it, but flips the switch and expects him to just sweep things under the carpet and act as though things are normal. He's expressed his discomfort around her trying to act like things are normal, and they are so close to finalizing the divorce.

I feel ridiculous for getting upset and anxious every time they have a good interaction, or she invites him out for a meal with their child. I promise I'm not jealous, without sounding arrogant, I have nothing to be jealous of. My partner has helped me work through a lot of my own past trauma and getting rid of toxic people from my life, and it kills me that he is not in a place to do the same. I voice to him generally how I feel about the entire situation, but I'm constantly worried about crossing some sort of line because I've never been married nor had a child, and I don't feel as though my opinion means very much considering I have zero experience in the area. To be clear, I don't punish him in any way for acting the way he does, he is very kind and is much better person than I am, and knows her better than I ever care to. I trust him, but I still feel this way.

How do I cope with my wildly protective emotions and constant irritation/anxiety with regards to the ex-wife?

"I have been trying to get stbxh to agree to financial settlement without going to court, but he just rejected my last offer. 
Background, this is in MD, we both have lawyers, married 8 years, no kids together (I have 3 kids from previous marriage.) throughout our marriage he worked at a business I financed for him.  He never took a salary because it was always in the red, failing. For years I wanted to sell, he always talked me out of it. Business finally closed and I was able to sell the property (did not make any money on the sale.) So for our whole marriage not only did I pay all the bills and mortgage on the house (purchased before we wed) I also lost over $150k of my own money in the failed business. 
Now he won‚Äôt just take a one time payment (which I feel is being overly generous on my part.) He is holding out for a % of my pension. I know MD law says he is entitled to a portion of what was contributed during out marriage. But I feel that does not take into consideration that he refused to get a paying job and never contributed toward bills or mortgage. I lived from paycheck to paycheck for years because of this.

"Hi all,

Second post for the day...

Where I live, it is common for couples to have a stag &amp; doe. More recently, people have just been holding a raffle and have been selling tickets online instead of an actual stag &amp; doe because of COVID. Having a raffle is what I was interested in doing but I didn't know how to go about it because you are supposed to have your bridal party pitch in to for the raffle prizes which I was unaware of that and didn't realize it was another expense for them. I already have them paying for other stuff so I didn't want to bother them with that. I just thought I would maybe throw it together with a little help from my fianc√©s family since they wanted to pitch in. Well, when we would ask them that we should start putting it together, we didn't get a response.

So I thought maybe the raffle just wasn't going to happen especially because my mom is insisting to throw me a bridal shower. I have been told to have either a raffle/stag &amp; doe or a shower but NOT both. Well, my mom is about starting to plan the shower and I just heard yesterday that my fianc√©s family started putting together the raffle for us and doing all the work which I do appreciate but now I am feeling very guilty about having both of these and don't want people to think we are cash/money grabbing by having a shower and raffle.

As soon as we got married and she moved in this side of her came out that just shocked me. She started snooping and going through my devices and found nothing. She flat out told me I'm shady because I delete things, so I probably deleted things I didn't want her to find. So then she told me she wanted a divorce. 

Since day 1 every little thing that comes up she says she wants a divorce. One example: I quit tobacco a few times. (Damn it's hard to quit tobacco.) But I don't drink, no drugs, just chewing tobacco. I hid it, she found it, wanted a divorce over that. 

For years she's been telling me she's filing for divorce and just wants out and I'm shady and this and that. I run my own landscape business so literally all I do is work. I'm never out at bars or out late with friends. But finally I just had enough and just said fine this is over. Let's do it.

But now she won't freakin leave. She says no this is my home too. And then she still wants to ""talk"" about things. That just ends in fights, which are pointless anyway because we're just waiting to sign. It was such a bad marriage according to her, I'm this, I'm that, blah blah blah. So leave!! How the hell do I live with this for 2 more months??? And what can I do to get her out when it's over?? I'm waiting to hear back from my lawyer on that last question. But just wondering what people did.",How the F so you live with each other while going through divorce???,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce
"I‚Äôd like to start off our marriage off on a high note by telling you that you were right. You were right when you thought it would be a good idea to knock on my door and ask me on a date when we were teenagers. You were right when you had some sort of inclination that we would make a perfect team, and you were right in thinking that I‚Äôd be head-over-heels excited to spend the rest of my life to you. 

I can never thank you enough for loving me so selflessly and so gently. You inspire me to be a better person, and you somehow have the most frustrating yet wonderful ability to make me smile no matter what. You make me excited for the future, and you have already filled my past with my favorite memories. 

I promise to love you in the mundane, through the extraordinary, and especially when it doesn‚Äôt come easy.

I promise to grow with you and dream with you.  I promise to keep holding your hand, knowing that every new crease and wrinkle is a sweet reminder of more and more years spent together. 

Most importantly, I will always remember the promise you made me when we were teenagers. I promise to always try, and to always forgive. To keep putting full effort into our relationship, and to have a forgiving heart when we continually realize that we‚Äôre imperfectly human.

"I'm currently going through a divorce. We've been together 20 year, married almost 16, 2 kids (6F &amp; 15M). However my husband started chatting with a female last July. He asked for a divorce New Years Day after spending Eve with her overnight instead of his family. I was so pissed and didn't really suspect anything which is why I didn't bother calling him while at my sister's celebrating. After a week I asked to see text messages between them and he allowed after a little back and forth. It seemed the I love you started in October and the plans of him marrying her were in December. I asked him to please not introduce the kids for at least 6 months and no overnight stays for a year. He agreed but went behind my back anyway and introduced him to this female. He gave me no real reason why other than he wanted the kids to see the new place, which by the way he is not living in yet together with her because her dad is religious and it's not allowed but I guess seeing a married man is just fine. He is wanting me to sign the 30 day waiver so he can automatically get married after the divorce and not wait. And he even told our daughter that her daughter was now her sister. I found that out later and explained to my daughter that she wasn't her sister, she was daughter of her dad's girlfriend. We aren't even divorce yet or even reviewed the decree and he is introducing this whole other family to our kids. My son hasn't even really comes to terms with it but says he happy for his dad when I think it's just something he is saying and my daughter doesn't even really truly get what is going on but yet she has a sister now. I think my soon to be ex husband is setting himself up for a world of hurt moving this fast and doing it the way he did. And I'm trying to minimize the damage but he is going behind my back.
Is it wrong for me to say she's not your sister? And was it unreasonable to ask to wait to introduce at a later time?",Am I wrong,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce
"Hi all! This is about my engagement party that will be next month but I have an idea it will happen with the wedding too. 

My parents and my future in laws agreed to have the cost of the engagement party split between them when we first started planning and they never brought up changing that since that day. All of us (me and fianc√©, both sets of parents) arranged a guest list but I was in charge of who was invited on ‚Äúmy side‚Äù and fianc√© was in charge of who he wanted on ‚Äúhis side‚Äù and made a big list of mutual friends all together. 

We organise catering for the party. My fianc√© was away so he couldn‚Äôt deal with it and my future mother in law didn‚Äôt have her phone working. I went over there to tell her right away to keep her in the loop. The exact words I used were when she asked how much of catering she had to pay after being told the price was ‚Äúit‚Äôs up to you of course‚Äù. 

She responded with ‚Äúwell since more of your side is going then we just might pay for our family‚Äù. Something about this doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. Sure I have a bigger number, but I already know most won‚Äôt be coming and told her so. My fianc√© decided who he wanted and that also included their mutual family friends.

"Hello.
I have been married to for 36 years to a man that I thought I would spend the rest of my life with. My husband and I were until this point the perfect couple. At least this was what I believed. He was a good man. In the past 2 years I have caught him texting using burner phones with several women. I gave him an autumatum  to stop or lose me. He stopped. We went to counseling.  He cried like I have never seen him cry after I told him that I was done. I gave him a chance.  We don't have children. I couldn't have them and I have no regrets.  
Months later we had bought an RV and new truck to retire and travel.  We have a cabin, a primary residence and was building a beach home. Every penny we made I doubled. This is how we have acquired everything we have. After 36 years I was ready to retire.  Then I caught him texting one particular younger women. He told he that he would never go with her because she 8s interested in his money. She is never going to he me and he could never love her. He stated he loves me and stated that he will regret hurting me for the rest of his life. I told him that if he would have loved me he would have stopped texting her. I asked told him that is either her or me. He lied and decided to leave because he didn't want to hurt me anymore.  We had been through counseling and I have never seen my husband cry the way he did when I asked him for a divorce. We were doing great. We bought everything to retire then I caught him texting her after several months. 
Today I gave him an ultimatum and he chose to leave. He only took several garments with him, because he thinks he can come back. I don't want him back. I don't want to see him. 36 years he threw away for someone that he said can't compare to me in looks, class or empathy.  However, he chose this. It took Mr 4 hours to pack his crap up so he can go and never come back. I am seeking a divorce lawyer on Monday.  I cannot be with someone who tells me that the AP is nobody but a person that wants his money and that he could never be with someone who is so easy. I gave my husband a beautiful life. I believe my ex now, is an affair fog. His family told him you are losing a good woman for trash. However, I don't want him anymore.  I packed him up texted him to come and packed up his clothes and texted him to get them tomorrow because he abandoned the marriage and the home. Can I change the locks. I don't want to see this man for as long as I live. He has tattoos of my face on his chest. He has tattoo of my name 6 times on his arms. This man loved me at one time very much. Yet, he chose to cheat. I'm okay with everything.  I'm not bitter. I know he will regret it. I just want to never see him again. I was told that he abandoned the home so I have a right to change the lock.",I'm done.,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"So I was reading around and stumbled across ""Walk Away Wife Syndrome"". 

Wife left me few weeks ago after 2 yrs married 6 dating. 

TBH, I knew that she wasn't fully happy, but she rarely expressed her emotion and it seemed she was good because she had a smile on her face and seemed to be OK. She was extremely nit picky with everything around the house, time we eat, activities we do together, what I wear, what we eat, what we watch on TV, etc. 

Sure, it was king of overwhelming at times, but every time I would bring something up that bothered me she would make me feel guilty for expressing my opinion. She really believed, ""Happy Wife happy life"" to the fullest extent. This made my life difficult because it felt my true opinions didn't matter and she much valued her own opinion over time, even if I have factual data which proved otherwise (this drove me crazy because I'm an engineer in business... facts and data is what I do).

She would hide her emotions and her true emotions would come out only in an argument when I would feel attacked, or I noticed towards the end every time we would have a drink or two of alcohol together. I actually said we should stop drinking together because every time we do it now something is always popping up from her.

I ever mentioned counseling months ago when I saw something was off and she insisted she isn't going to go again because ""we already did that"". I directly asked her several times if she is OK and she never would really open up. Sometimes, she would open but rarely. 

She even told me she cries alone when I'm not there. She doesn't have direct hobbies outside of cooking, some light exercise, and gardening/reading books. She also worked from home and was home 80% of the time. 

I really wanted her to trust me and open up honestly, it's all I've ever wanted and I expressed this alot. She has had trust issues her whole life and had difficulty Retaining friendships besides her mom, dad and immediate family. 

Never cheated never lied no abuse, always supported and tried with her, but I still maintained my own identity with hobbies, work and friends. 

Not sure what I could have done much different, I really did try to be a good husband to her. I just can't make a woman love me, this is the second time she has left. I am not chasing anymore and getting back in the gym and focusing on work my my personal growth. Its like she never loved me for who I was... but the person she wanted me to be. I changed quite alot in my life and gave her a huge part of me. 

Heads up stay strong focus on yourselves, better your mind and spirit and be stronger for the next one. I loved this woman and she is truly a nice person, and I did wish her the best. I did love her and always will and she made me a better person. We just can't unfortunately work together and be truly open.",Walk Away Wife Syndrome,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"Partially a long vent / looking for advice in the tldr. 

 So we have a small (30 people) wedding planned for the summer. Fianc√© and I each have three GM/BMs in the wedding party. Early on, we established that everything was going to be pretty low key, and planning has been going well. 

Last night, he was really excited because his guys planned him a four day camping weekend for his bach, which is AWESOME. He never really takes time for himself nor is he good at being the center of attention and this is making him feel really special. 

He asked me if my bach date had been set.. and I feel awful because I started crying and said I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to happen. I feel like I pooped on his parade and I‚Äôm not happy with myself about that, because I am genuinely excited for him. 

My girls have not cohesively talked about a bach for me, at all. One BM asked me early on what I was thinking - I had mentioned maybe doing a rental in wine country nearby, but if that was cost prohibitive I‚Äôm happy to just have an old school pajama party at our house, maybe go out for drinks locally. It got brought up again two months ago, for five minutes, just with her, and nothing since. 

I kind of tried to set myself up early to be understanding that it might not happen; 2/3 bridesmaids live out of state and in the past 6 months- 1 had a baby, 1 had a messy break up with her long term boyfriend, and 1‚Äôs partner lost their job. So money, travel, time are all costly for them. Despite knowing a bach might be a challenge I‚Äôm still sad, and now feel guilty about being sad. 

My fianc√© wants to find a way for me to do something nice before the wedding. He asked if I‚Äôd considered chatting with my local girlfriends who aren‚Äôt in the wedding party; I don‚Äôt really feel comfortable asking them to coordinate something the wedding party really should be handling. He asked if I wanted to do something with the one local bridesmaid and maybe it‚Äôs just my hurt feelings talking to but I don‚Äôt. 

So short story long/TLDR: I‚Äôm trying to come up with an idea to treat myself to something nice before the wedding. A spa day is okay but I really wanted more of a retreat away from home. If anyone has any advice or things they did as a solo celebration before their wedding, I‚Äôd love to hear it. 

Also, if I‚Äôm not handling this well I‚Äôm open to hear that too. I feel like I‚Äôm probably just caught in my feelings, and if there‚Äôs a way to make things happen without being demanding or a zilla that I‚Äôm just not thinking clearly on, please share.

"I'm just under 4 months out and trying to decide how to allocate my decor budget.

I would love to know what others are getting and what you're skipping and how much roughly you're spending. I've got ¬£500 on flowers, ¬£200 on decor (but currently half of that is just 'other' and not for anything specific) and then ¬£60 for on the day stationery. 

Ceremony: floral arrangement for the ceremony table  (¬£150 - will move to reception after ceremony), there's also a mantlepiece which we may put some more flowers on (that will then be moved to be used for the dining tables) 

Reception: white bunting for the bar area (¬£42 for 30m from amazon), cardboard cut-out of our dog (¬£25). I'll also take a vase from home to put my bouquet in which can then become part of the decor. 

Tables: we're not really doing centrepieces we will just have a few bud vases with flowers. We have ordered 2 buckets of unarranged stems (¬£150) from our florist which we willl arrange the day before. We're using some empty glass bottles as vases (free). We have a chalk pen we will use to write table numbers on the bottles. This should be enough to also have a few extra to decorate the guestbook and card table. Also I may buy some menu holders or frames to display the menus on each table (rather than individual menu per plate). 

For the cards, we will use a basket we already own and I wasn't going to put a sign on it, but just put an empty envelope in there with our names on so its clear what it's for.

We are going to do a polaroid guestbook which I budgeted ¬£150 for (not including the camera which we will borrow). I hope that covers some film, props, guestbook, tape and pens. If we do a sign with instructions then I'll probably just use a frame we already own and print it at home. 

The only other signs we will have are a big order of the day and seating plan. The venue have easels we can use to display them. 

I am happy not buying anything other than what I already mentioned, but would love to know what everyone else is buying and if it seems like I'm missing anything!",What decor did you buy (or planning to) and what will you skip?,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning

Hey Reddit,

If you saw my previous posts, then you probably know I am going through a divorce at my wife‚Äôs request (originally). It has been an emotional rollercoaster, nearly every day since the beginning of February.

Here is an update on things:

I got a lawyer in early March and on the 15th I filed for divorce.  She wasn't taking any actions other than continuing to party and enjoy her ""new life"" and I refused to be a victim to it.

After talking with my wife, she agreed to drop the hearing for an order of protection, so the court date was cancelled. She also agreed to talk to my lawyer before jumping into defense and turning this into a drawn out legal battle.

Afterwards, we laid out all our assets on a spreadsheet, divided them fairly and made notes.  We have also closed out all joint accounts and cards.

We were easily able to agree to shared custody with a 2-2-5-5 Schedule which works nicely with both of our schedules.

I knew from the beginning that we wouldn‚Äôt really disagree on anything major, so this wasn‚Äôt a surprise to me.

Fast forward a few days, her sister is in town and spills the beans that ‚Äúthe reason she was always trying to stay the night at a friend‚Äôs house often before all this happened wasn‚Äôt to have an affair (that just kind of happened) ‚Ä¶ it was to experiment with drugs.‚Äù WHAT THE FUCK‚Ä¶

I am probably overreacting, but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm typing this out on reddit instead of blowing up. I really want to call my lawyer and say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt write up that custody agreement just yet!‚Äù She will deny it, I am sure it‚Äôs just Shrooms and ecstasy, not Heroine or meth, so I doubt a drug test would prove anything. Am I overreacting? What would a calm rational person do in this situation? 

I am so hurt and angry and don't know how to ""suck it up"" I don't want to escalate things but I really want to snap.","Updates, sadness, anger and confusion.",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"Hi weddit,

I'm looking for some advice on collecting RSVPs for our wedding shower to help out my mom. Basically, my mom is throwing us a wedding shower so my family can meet my fianc√©, which we're really excited about. We've been together for years, but the majority my aunts and uncles (on both of my parents sides) live in the northeast whereas we're in the south. Therefore, the wedding shower is in the northeast so it is convenient for both sides of my family. 

The tricky part is that my parents are divorced and really do not get along. My Dad's side of the family isn't terribly fond of my Mom either. I also have a bit of a strained relationship with my dad, and with anything wedding related he is uninterested and will quickly change the subject. My Dad was invited to the wedding shower but will not attend. Now the RSVP date for the shower is approaching this week, but my Dad's side has not RSVP'd to my Mom. Since my Dad won't be a big help with collecting RSVPs, I was thinking about reaching out to his side to encourage them to RSVP to my Mom, but I'm not sure if that would be weird etiquette-wise. There is one aunt on my Dad's side that has been helpful for getting wedding info to that side of the family. I'm not sure if it would be better to reach out to her to see if she can encourage some RSVPs, but she also has not RSVP'd. Honestly, it's alright if they don't want to attend, it's just important that they communicate that info.

"I (41M) met my wife (42F) in in march of '06. It started out great of course. Fast forward to 2011. She no longer works, we're living with family, and it's just me supporting us. No big deal. I can handle it, but suggest she take some time and find something so we can be a little better off. She's handling housework since she's home all the time. So it works out. Jump to August of '21, I'm working 40+ hour weeks and going to school full-time, she's still not working, housework is either not getting done at all, or I have to initiate it before she gets up to help. Basic things like laundry/dishes aren't getting done unless I do them, or essentially nag constantly. 

We have just one vehicle, but her mom allowed the use of her van (in shambles), so since I know what to do if it breaks down, I take it to work and she takes our car since its safer. Caring for her family is the most she's done in several years. No her mother has passed, grandma is getting better care in a nursing home, and sister is sitting in the home she shared with her mom/grandma alone. Sister, in my opinion, refuses to do anything for herself. EXAMPLE: sister would call wife to make a 50 mile round trip to help take out garbage, or bring her mcdonalds when she won't even get up to get the door for delivery. Now, wife asks how I would feel if sister lived with us in some capacity. No talk of how her cost of living would be covered. I bring it up and am met with ""I don't know"" for everything. Wife and I are barely treading water. 

I've asked many times for her to find work. To handle the household. To do the basic things that obviously need to be done so it's less I need to stress about getting done. Nothing. It seems like it took me saying that I am severely unhappy and am going to start doing things to make myself happy, getting angry, and being clear I want nothing to do with any life insurance disbursement from her mothers passing for her to even apply for a few jobs. It's gone far beyond just being frustrated with nothing getting done unless I do it. Wife isn't a morning person, I am, so when there is a task I prefer to get it done early in the day so I have less to do before bed. I feel like my saying I want nothing to do with any life insurance disbursement was enough of an eye-opener to make her start doing more around the house. But that doesn't make sense. Our biggest hurdle has always been finances. We live check to check now. Is it the thought that, knowing I have no idea where I'll get the financing from to start my business, I want nothing to do with any disbursement the only thing to try to fix things? Or is it an attempt to placate me enough that I become less stressed for now? 

I don't feel like I can depend on her at all. I'm trying to work as much overtime as possible, I'm trying to finish my degree, and I'm trying to start a business. I've asked for help. Many times. I've flat out said I cannot do this by myself. I'm usually met with ""I'm so overwhelmed I don't know where to start"" followed by tears. But that seems to apply to anything. Building a resume. Applying for work. Cleaning. Washing dishes. As far as sex goes, that hasn't happened in 5 years maybe? She's got various issues and I can accept/understand her reasons for not wanting it. 

I just don't know what to do. I feel responsible for wife, I guess? She's an adult, I am in no way responsible for her. She's lived with me being the sole provider for 11 years. I tried to be understanding of her medical issues, aches, pains, mental health, whatever came up. But come on... I don't want to seem dismissive, but we all have various issues that are hard to overcome, but still do everyday. My knee has become a painful issue as of late. I asked wife what she would do if I'm down and unable to work for an extended period of time. Waiting for disability. ""I don't know"". 

What do I do? I want out, but how do I break it to her? What happens next? Part of me wants what I believe is the easy way out and just pack my shit and leave. I've only reached out to one attorney, but they wanted a couple hundred dollars for just the consultation, so that went out the window. Suggestions? Help? Advice? Tell me I'm wrong and being a selfish fuck?","I want out, no idea how to break it to her",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"**Background:** My family and my fiance's family live on opposite sides of the country. To accommodate everyone to the best of our ability, we are having two wedding celebrations, one for my family on the west coast, and one for his family on the east coast. Both are strictly receptions. We will be getting married in a private ceremony with just parents/siblings beforehand. Both receptions will be relatively low-key and casual. 

**Plan for Reception:** For the reception on the west coast (for my family and friends) we are planning a lunchtime reception (August 2022, from 12-4pm) in my parents' backyard. We will have around 65 people in attendance. We are trying to keep expenses relatively low (we are making all food, decorations, and just rented a tent plus tables/chairs). We will have music playing via a playlist, but don't have a dance floor. There are no seating arrangements. 

**Question/Concern:** I've been really stressing about how to make this not feel like it's just a backyard bbq. While most in attendance won't be coming from far, we actually do have some friends who will be flying in for this. I want to make it worth their time/travel, and make it feel like a fun, meaningful event. I would love some advice and ideas for things to do/create structure without it feeling too regimented.

**Some things I already have in mind:**  
\- A toast of some sort  
\- Cutting of cake  
\- A storyboard with pictures of us throughout the years--starting from when we met to our recent engagement. People can freely walk through and look at pictures.  
\- Yard games (we have cornhole)  
\- First dance (although my fiance and I would really prefer not to, plus there's no dance floor)  
\- Words from my parents and/or sibling

Any other ideas/advice? I feel as though I often don't give people enough credit with the fact that they can chat with others and entertain themselves that way. But, I do feel responsible for entertaining people and making it worth the trip.

"Hi everyone,

To try to make a long story short, I was supposed to get married in June 2020, we got married legally last year and this June we're having the postponed reception.

Because I'm 33 and my partner 38 a lot has happened in our friends' lives in these 2 years, mostly babies lol, which means that we have a very sad 50% attendance rate (compared to 95% two years ago...), including some very close friends missing. 

It makes so sad, even though I understand the reasons why, and a lot of friends have suggested doing a vow renewal in 10 years for instance. I could see how people might be more ""free"" in their 40s and not have tiny babies to work around, but if people can't come to a wedding I'm very skeptical that they would for a vow renewal. My partner and I are from two different countries, so no matter where we host a reception some people have to fly. 

This is all very hypothetical, and maybe not the right sub, but I'm curious to know if people have hosted/been to vow renewals ? Was it worth the planning and expense ?",Has anyone done a vow renewal reception and was it worth it ?,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,Divorce,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning

"Long story short, my spouse is not involved in our child‚Äôs life despite being physically present. He has some severe childhood trauma that has surfaced since I became pregnant and it has greatly affected his ability to connect with our child or be involved in their care much at all. He is aware of this and has expressed to me that he does not feel able to improve his connection and involvement with our 2 year old, despite me urging and encouraging him to, because our child deserves a present father.
That said, he does have a big ego and I know he will be triggered once I bring up divorce. He will not want to look like a deadbeat (understandable), so I know I will need to cater to that. 
Assuming a defensive response from him (which I do anticipate), how can I be prepared to try and work through it with him in mediation? 
My goal is to have as much consistency for our child as possible. He and I both agree that he is not able to provide that nurturing parental role to our child. That said, he and our child both deserve to be a part of each other‚Äôs lives and I do not want to impede on that. Frankly, I would love for him to be a ‚ÄúDisney dad/ fun parent‚Äù and at least have that role in their life. I‚Äôm okay with being the stable, supportive and constant, yet possibly less fun parent. 
What type of custody/visitation schedule should I propose to him that would allow our child to have a steady home environment under my roof as much as possible, but also have him involved enough to have our child feel like they have a caring father (as much as he is capable of at least) and also cater to his need to come across as an involved dad to the outside world/friends/family? 
I‚Äôm praying we can come to an agreement and he doesn‚Äôt get super angry/defensive and fight me. Our child is a very anxious toddler (I‚Äôm actively seeking therapy for them) and I really do worry about not being able to provide a sense of stability and safety.

I am posting 7 months after being the maid of honor for my sister to drive home the message to state what you expect and hope to see your maid of honor do during your big day! I'm not a fan of weddings and pretty much don't like them, but I was happy to take on the role of being a MOH for my sister. I worked with her on making her big-day-dreams come true for almost two years!

My sisters wedding was spectacular! She had a great day, but the scheduling was bonkers and her venue coordinator was useless the day of. My sister had ""hoped"" to have time to do first looks before going up to her ""I do"" spot, but because of going over  time on the getting ready photos, her first looks had to occur a few minutes before vows right outside the ""I do"" spot. Months later I'm still reminded how I *should've* kept us all on track during the getting ready photos.

"GA. Separated living 10 min away for 4 weeks. Got served papers last week. 3 kids (14, 13, 10). Prelim court date end of March.

Over the past 4 weeks she has not agreed to a schedule for parenting time. She continues to site that the children do not want to see me or need more time for consistent visitation. I get scraps and she hides behind the ‚Äúchildren have rights to refuse‚Äù argument. The scraps I‚Äôve been given have ranged from 16 total visitation hours for my eldest to 37 hours for my youngest. She will not allow overnights stating the children want time to adjust. On Sundays she demands I not take them out of her church and coaches the children to no go with me unless I take them to her church. When I speak to the children privately I get mixed answers. There is no abuse on my part.

QUESTION: yesterday (Sunday) I texted that her I needed a schedule and told her I needed them for 3 day for what amounted to 19 hours. After 3 hours she replied that the children said it was too much and they could only do 2 days for 8 hours combined (2 of which while I work). I told her I refuse and until she gives me meaningful parenting time I will continue to note she‚Äôs refusing me parenting time. Am I shooting myself in the foot and should I take the 8 hours?

"I feel I developed Body Dysmorphia ever since I started to plan this wedding. I've tried on wedding dresses, gotten hair &amp; makeup trials done but everything is extremely underwhelming. I don't think I am going to look pretty on my wedding day and I don't know how to feel about that.

I have always had good self-esteem and felt like I was a normally cute woman. However, this wedding has really highlighted how bland my body and my look is.

I went in for a 2nd makeup trial today with a brand new makeup artist(who is also a friend) because the 1st one didn't do a great job and wouldn't do a 2nd trial. I have gotten my makeup done a handful of times over the years and 5/6 times I loved what they did! However, I don't know whats going on...

I got my makeup done by this makeup artist I have used plenty of times in the past but I looked at myself in the mirror and wanted to cry. It looked like someone slapped me with makeup...I don't know if its because I am 32 now? I got my makeup professionally done a lot when I was 24-27 when I was younger/cuter.

I feel I will have to pay for another makeup trial...thatll be another $100...because I can't find a new makeup artist because this one is an old friend of mine but I am in shock at how ugly I looked afterwards.

I wish I could just do the makeup myself. I have been doing my makeup a lot lately and my fiance always comments on it and says that he likes what I am doing. I think I can do a really good natural look whereas I feel makeup artists go overboard all the time.

I am also a photographer so I understand that you need to apply the makeup heavy in order for it to show on camera but my fiance saw my first makeup trial look and we both agreed it was too much makeup and that I didnt look like myself. My biggest worry is that I will be too overdone when he sees me at the alter :(

Wedding Dresses are another story but my body is not womanly and everything I try on just looks like the dress is wearing me. I did buy something online that I thought was simple yet glamourous enough for a wedding but it has a cowl neck and I have no boobs so it just seems like THAT is also not going to work out now.

I think I've just accepted I am going to look ridiculous on my wedding day and I am just sad.

I enjoyed reading other breakdowns and they were very helpful to see a range of costs for different categories. So I hope this helps you! Sorry I haven't provided better pictures, just trying not to be too identity revealing.

**People: 75** (including us). 180 invited, 75 RSVPed Yes, 2 canceled last minute (they had potential issues we were aware of early on), 73 showed up. We had a great turnout because almost everyone had to travel by plane or car for hours to get to us, so guests likely didn't commit unless they planned it out first. We also expected lots of Nos due to the distance, so that wasn't a surprise either.

**Contributions: $10k** from parents, **$6800** from wedding gifts. We fronted the costs, but **our net expense was $10,200**. Prior to finding out about our parents gift, our budget was $15k. They gave us 10k with the express wish that we be less frugal (they know us well lol). So then we bumped up the budget to $25k, and of course ended up going over that.

**THE BREAKDOWN**

*\*all numbers are post tax and tips, and rounded up to account for any random items*

**Food &amp; Beverage = $10,000**. We had charcuterie and lots of hors d'oeuvres during cocktail hour, plated appetizers and 3 options for entrees. Open bar with house selection, plus a few special beers and our signature drinks. Food/beverage was our highest priority, and everything turned out delicious - we were so happy with this!! Got lots of compliments on the food.

**Venue = $4550.** Based on the food/beverage spend + some fees. Pretty but not stuffy (for us) country club - we just wanted a venue that looked nice enough to not need extra decor, and as inclusive as possible to minimize extra coordination with more vendors. The package included separate ceremony space, event/day of coordinator, reception tables/chairs/linens/dining stuff, set up/take down and service. The staff were wonderful throughout the night! They even made sure to save us appetizers, and initially served everyone very strong cocktails (lol) - we appreciated their enthusiasm but did ask for them to tone it down a bit just to avoid everyone getting drunk too fast haha

**Dessert = $400**. 220 mini cupcakes in 3 flavors and rented displays, from a local bakery. Moist and yummy but I only had one cupcake...all gone by the end of the night. Glad people enjoyed them! We chose minis because we thought people would want to try all the flavors but not want to eat 3 whole cupcakes.

**Photography = $2900**. 8 hours with 2 photographers, and 1.5 hour engagement session. This was such a steal, and the pictures turned out stunning! Super easy to get along with and very sweet pair. They even stayed over the allotted time, like 2 hours extra - I didn't notice until they said goodbye.

**DJ = $1100**. Included 6 hours, ceremony and reception. We just wanted a DJ who would play decent music and use our lists, and they did exactly that! Was the 2nd cheapest we found, and was great.

**Photobooth = $500**. Included 3 hour open-concept booth, props, print outs for guests, and a flash drive for us with all the images. Everyone had lots of fun and we got many silly shots.

**Guest transportation = $1800**. 2 shuttles for a 7 hour time period. We really underestimated this, thought $1k at most. For transporting guests to/from recommended hotels to the venue. Assumed there'd be plenty available so we booked late, but with few options, paid more than expected. Still worth it since many guests used them (esp. drunk ones), and so did we.

**Bride Attire = $1400**. Wedding dress $800 (50% off from BHLDN), rehearsal dress $270, hemming for both plus bustle for wedding dress was $300, nude flats $30. I lusted after this dress for months online, and pounced during a sale. It was the only wedding dress I tried on, and turned out to be the one. Borrowed a lovely pearl necklace from MIL, wore my pearl bracelet that my partner gifted me at the beginning of our relationship. My make up was my go-to lip stain from Sephora. I loved how I felt and looked!

**Groom Attire = $150**. My partner got a new shirt, tie, and suspenders. He wore a suit he already had, bought as a groomsmen for a wedding. And wore nice shoes he already had. He was gorgeous!

**Wedding Bands = $350.** Mine was $330, 14k gold from an Etsy jeweler. My partner chose a $20 tungsten carbide one from Amazon lol. We both got cheap silicone ones for working out too.

**Floral arrangements = $450**. All faux flowers and greens from Joann sales. Made my bouquet, 20 med arrangements, 1 med wreath, 2 large altar vases, and flower girl basket. Thrifted vases and wire wreath, got fairy lights from Amazon. More info in previous posts if you're interested in my DIY florals. I love how they came out, and I'm so glad to keep my bouquet forever. Will be reselling the rest.

**Paper goods = $150**. Bulk of this were place cards $80 (Minted). The rest of includes save the dates (Minted), invites (Canva), and postage. Most of our STDs and invites were emailed out through WithJoy for free. We ordered some paper versions for the households who didn't have/use email. RSVPing was all online through our website, links on the invites. We only had a few people email us directly. Almost all our guests RSVPed on time, so we're glad that worked out.

**Other decor = $100**. Kept things minimal. Thrifted a card box, candle holders and candles, and picture frames for signs. Got guestbook from Amazon, a few lanterns on sale from Joann. Borrowed paint from a friend and DIY'd our big signs on art paper I had. Used Canva to design smaller signs and printed them out at the library.

**Rehearsal dinner = $800**. For immediate family only, just a reservation at a super nice restaurant. It was the most scrumptious and abundant food. Like, huge plates and all tasted amazing. Best ever!!

**Welcome party + after party = $2300**. Hosted in our hotel's event spaces. We had hors d'oeuvres at the welcome party, and late night bar food at the after party. Both parties had open bars. We were so glad for both, because they gave us more time to chat to guests. We also stayed up super late with our last awake guests, and then went upstairs and passed out blissfully.

**Lodgings = $0 from sheer luck.** Our hotel stay was comped for us that weekend, because they had accidentally overbooked our suite. Put us in a bit smaller suite for free!

**What turned out well:**

Pretty much all of it! We spent alot of time deciding at the beginning, what kind of experiences we wanted to prioritize and what spending we wanted to allocate to match our priorities - not any else's, despite some strongly opinionated people in my family. We made our own ceremony in collaboration with our awesome family member officiant, wrote our own vows, nixed a lot of traditional stuff like wedding parties (just hung out with friends informally while getting ready) and other things that we didn't care enough to spend on, and then splurged on the stuff we did really want. Totally worth it.

**What we'd change:**

Okay, so I do feel bad about my rehearsal dinner dress costing as much as it did. Besides my wedding gown, it's the most expensive clothing item I own now. I love it and purposely chose a dress that I could wear again often, but still...so pricey (for me)! Lol, that's the only thing I kind of but not really but kind of regret. Ugh, I just need to wear this dress everywhere I can.

**Final thoughts:** Would highly recommend soon after the wedding, just writing down moments or things you remember enjoying, appreciating, finding funny, surprising, etc. My partner suggested this, and we're glad to have that long list to look back on in addition to the photos (especially for me since I have terrible memory).","$27k Wedding with 75 people, Upstate NY in Fall 2021 - Recap/Budget",weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning

"My ex has made plenty of questionable parenting choices, but many of them are not hills on which I‚Äôm willing to die - and he is notorious for turning things around on me, so I only fight back when I feel it‚Äôs totally necessary because he makes me feel awful about myself. A lot of it is projection on his part, but that‚Äôs another story. 

We have 12 yo twins. Not long ago he went off of me for allowing them to stay home alone when going to the grocery store, but ultimately backed off, saying it‚Äôs ultimately my choice and I‚Äôm going to do what I‚Äôm going to do. I trust my kids home alone and they‚Äôre 12! I think I started babysitting around that age. 

Anyway, apparently he‚Äôs finally on board with this because they said that he‚Äôs been going out skating on Thursday nights for ‚Äúadult skate‚Äù at the rink - which I‚Äôm fine with. What I‚Äôm not fine with is that he won‚Äôt allow them to have phones (which I understand), but he does not have a house phone. If there was an emergency they‚Äôd have no way to call 911. He‚Äôs told them if there‚Äôs an emergency to go to the neighbors. But what if they aren‚Äôt home?! And what if someone is choking? By the time they get there, that twin is dead. I feel like this is full on neglect. They do have devices so I‚Äôve shown them how to use google duo to make phone calls on their tablet if he‚Äôs not home. 

I have now gotten them a ‚Äúburner phone‚Äù to take and hide in case of emergencies until I‚Äôm ready to confront him on this issue. I don‚Äôt condone lying or hiding things from him, but I‚Äôm trying to get my ducks in a row before fighting him on this. He‚Äôs very volatile with me and I want to have my arguments well thought out before I open the floodgates. 

What would you do? I‚Äôm right to be livid, right? He turns everything into a fight so I‚Äôve not laid into him yet because they‚Äôre with me this week. I just can‚Äôt believe he thinks this is okay. 

This man has just turned our lives upside down and I‚Äôm exhausted from it. He is a very good dad in many respects, or else I would have fought for full custody - but the ways he‚Äôs failing are BIG and he refuses to even try to see my side. In his mind, ‚Äúdad is always right‚Äù and he shuts me down with his own skewed and antiquated parenting rational, so arguing with him feels impossible. 

I‚Äôm open to any input y‚Äôall might have before I approach this subject with him. I‚Äôve tried to get him to attend some sort of parenting mediation with me but he refuses. He also refused it when we separated, and it was hard for me to insist because Covid had everything shut down. I feel like we need it more than ever now, but he does not communicate with me, and last time I tried to comment on his parenting (you‚Äôll see in my previous posts where he was threatening them with spankings as 12 years old) and all he said was ‚Äúfuck you for making me out to be a horrible parent.‚Äù

"Hi Weddit -- hoping someone has a recommendation for processional and/or recessional music. My fiance and I have hired a string trio, but are having a hard time landing on specific songs for the ceremony.

We really don't like the super traditional stuff (Canon in D, etc.) but also aren't super into pop music played on strings (Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, etc.). Those are all beautiful options, just not right for us. That said, does anyone have recommendations for options that would have that classic string sound, but wouldn't be extremely identifiable?

I've posted on here on several occasions over the last 5 months... I'm (Husband) am not taking the divorce very well. 

Back-stroy: Wife is on a crazy ride, her career took off like a rocket... She works in the professional fields, I won't disclose  it.  I am totally in support of her, and was willing to adjust my life to facilitate her progress.  She decided that being single was her best option, this allows her to make decisions, work late, go out of town, state, and County on a moments notice with out having regrets, or responsibility of still maintaining a relationship.  She lives on her own now, we haven't talked but  two text messages that were instructions on a unrelated topic.  

Fast forward:  Out of the blue she was invited to ti present an ideal she has been working on to some of the most important people in her professional world... this is a pinnacle moment for some that usually take years if not decades to do...

After she left,  she called me? She said she had know one else to tell? I heard her choke-up a little bit..  

I congratulated her, told her I was proud, told her that she is better at what she does more than she gives herself credit for... and that I know she is going to be one of the top people in the room soon enough.  

Then she tells me of an upcoming trip she is doing for work, and wanted to keep me informed incase of ....? I don't remember incase of what she said... I was having a hard time trying to figure out why she was even letting me know... 

I love her, I care about her,  and she knows that.... 

She was either reaching out..... or she was just actually wanting me to be proud of her, even after all this... 

I don't know what to think? 

About 2 hour later, I sent her a voice text... All I said is the I wanted to reconfirm with her that I was extremely proud of everything she is and has done with her career...

2 hour later she responded with ""thank you, that she had listened to it several time....  Thats the most text, and the fastest response I've gotten in 4 months.

"I realize now that my life has been one long grieving process. 

When I was young my home circumstances left much to be desired. 

So, I went into foster-care and spent a few not-so-great years there.  

I remember the rage. I was always so angry at everyone. Ready to lash out verbally and physically.

That rage consumed me; colored everything about who and how I was.  

Then I was adopted. 

Things were great for a few years and then my adoptive dad became an abusive alcoholic. 

The rage that had largely subsided resurfaced, stronger and meaner than before, backed by age and intellect. 

I entered adult-hood, without resources, having lost two families, and looking for someone, anyone,  who would unconditionally love me.  

I bounced around between biological aunts, cousins, and  parental figures but was unable to resonate with the broken people around me. 

I was broken too, but not the same way they were; my failings, as far as I could tell, weren't moralistic or ethical in nature. 

I was always so angry, so full of rage at the world, at my impotence, at my circumstance, at the sheer unfairness of it all. 

Then I met Brie. 

I loved her and lost her. She loved me and left me. 

But she saved me. Over the years. Being who and what she was for me; helping me to carry so much weight. 

Now, as I navigate the grieving process year after year I look back and realize that's what I've been doing my whole life: grieving, in one way or another, all the loss. 

Not being able or willing to contextualize our relationships dissolution in an emotionally violent sense forced me to reevaluate things. 

I'm not angry anymore. 

I am sad, heartbroken, exhausted, and always ready to cry. 

But the rage is gone.

"He‚Äôs literally fighting me over what the doctor said! It‚Äôs so incredibly exhausting. I am frustrated because he‚Äôs turning everything into an issue of control. Our daughter (who is now 3) as a baby had a history of colic and acid reflux. She was a very hungry fussy babe. I have even posted about it on Reddit dating three years back. She started getting colic when we switched from breast milk to formula and we realised it must be the dairy. We switched to a lactose-free formula and gave her dairy only occasionally. She doesn‚Äôt eat cheese mainly because I don‚Äôt eat dairy and I was doing all the cooking. She has always had non-dairy milk and for yoghurt, we have always given her those Alpro soy yoghurts. Even when things were tense between us and we were cohabiting despite being separated, meal wise we were on top of it. Now everything he has to turn into an issue of control. It‚Äôs not that she has never had dairy but always small amounts and special occasion treats. She was never the type to eat cheese sandwiches, drink milkshakes or eat dairy yoghurt.¬†

She‚Äôs been having an upset stomach every time she‚Äôs back from being with him, very gassy and diarrhoea. I attributed it to anxiety of switching between houses at first. She is 3 so talks a fair bit so I did start to ask her about what she eats there especially because she wants items I never buy when we go shopping. It‚Äôs always junk, McDonald's, other junk food and convenience foods. She is also drinking whole dairy and eating yoghurt and cheese regularly. A few times she mentioned vomiting at his.

I asked him if she‚Äôs experiencing stomach issues when she is with him because on her first day back with me she always has a lot of gas and goes for a bowel movement more often than usual. He messages me with a ‚Äúno‚Äù back. Which is fine and that was better than what came afterwards. I go to drop her off in that same week to him and he goes on a rant about me being an awful parent and making her sick and goes on a barrage insulting me. Keep in mind that she has already been telling me what she has been eating there and that she vomited once or twice so his ‚Äúno‚Äù blatant lie.

The stomach issue of course continues, the same pattern she goes back from her days with him and the first day she has diarrhoea and a lot of gas. I talk to the GP on the phone (doctor) who knows her since she was a baby and about our problems with colic and formula. She says to try and cut down on dairy. That‚Äôs fine with me because she isn‚Äôt having any here. She kindly wrote it out for me so I could just show him that evidence, I send it to him and tell him to please cut down on the fast food and amount of dairy she eats. He replies with an ‚Äùok‚Äù. That means fuck all. Because the next time he goes out of his way to pick her up from my place just to say what he truly thinks. He goes off and gets in my face about it. Heavily projecting because he calls me a fucking psycho and tells me I have no control over what happens in his home and I should fucking stop trying to control what he does and should fucking stop trying to be in control of everything. With those exact words.

it‚Äôs ironic, I would have laughed if this wasn‚Äôt about my daughter‚Äôs wellbeing. So I just tell him to refer back to the letter from the doctor and close the door. But I am exhausted. I am so fucking done with it because why, why is he doing this? What does he even get out of it? Why does everything have to be a fight or a way for him to get back at me? It‚Äôs seriously insane. I was this close to yell back and ask him what the hell he‚Äôs getting out of this.

This isn‚Äôt a first of course because he did the same thing giving her an iPad when we had always agreed not to and when I tried to have a normal conversation about her iPad use with him he reacted the same way. He doesn‚Äôt care. He won‚Äôt even attend doctor‚Äôs appointments but I always make sure to tell him the time and date if she has any and he either ignores it or says ‚Äúok thanks‚Äù.¬†

Now I can‚Äôt even do what the GP said. I can‚Äôt keep a diary of what she eats because he won‚Äôt keep one and I can‚Äôt keep her off dairy for the recommended time either.¬†

The most frustrating thing of all is there is a 50% chance he agrees with me and has acknowledged to cut down her dairy intake but just because he likes the drama, instead of just agreeing with me he will act like I‚Äôm wrong. Now I am just left assuming. The doctor did say that she can be sent for a hospital referral for a test to see if she is indeed lactose intolerant. He is more likely to attend an actual hospital appointment that we‚Äôd both be present for but I can already imagine the drama that will ensue before, after and during.",He‚Äôs refusing to follow what the doctor said about our child just because he hates me.

My grandma accidentally let slip that my aunts plan is to potentially bring her best friend instead of my uncle as her date to my wedding. I would of course understand if he had to back out last minute because of his health, I love my uncle and while I‚Äôd be delighted if he could come, we‚Äôd make sure to send him a video recording if he had to miss it. My aunt wouldn‚Äôt be lonely regardless, she‚Äôll have 20 other family members there, including her mom, sisters, kids and grandkids, and the wedding is less than 3hrs drive from where she lives. 

I‚Äôm getting stressed thinking about this because to me it feels really disrespectful for her to assume she can substitute a date without asking (I would not be upset if she asked, but I‚Äôd politely say no). My aunt and uncle were invited, not my aunt +1. We kept our guest list to around 60 guests, and while all SO‚Äôs/fianc√©es/spouses were invited, no one was given a ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù plus one. We kept the guest list shorter because we want to celebrate with the people we love the most. It‚Äôs a boundary that I thought I‚Äôd set pretty firmly by addressing invites only to those invited. I know 60 isn‚Äôt super small, but it really is just our closest friends and family. My aunt‚Äôs friend is nice, but I‚Äôm not close with her and I‚Äôd feel weird having her there, when there are friends we couldn‚Äôt invite in order to keep the guest list small.

Not that this matters - because this is more about boundaries and less about cost - but if we really wanted to ‚Äúfill a spot‚Äù for someone cancelling last minute, there are a people I can think of who I know would be understanding of being added last minute, and that we are much closer with than my aunt‚Äôs friend.

I‚Äôm hurt because it feels like even though my family loves to say ‚Äúlet us know if we can help with the wedding!‚Äù, all they really need to do to help is not cause drama lol, or even better, deal with each other‚Äôs drama before it gets to me. I‚Äôm a little bit blown away that no one told my aunt she needs to ask before making this plan.

My husband (M54) and I (F48) (two children 13, 10, two properties) have opted for mediation first because:

1. We have worked through all the major points of agreement, produced a document leaving a few areas where we either don't feel we have the right knowledge, and both have different viewpoints - mainly childcare arrangement (he's a shift worker, see my previous posts)
2. Even though we have worked through a lot of separation issues rationally, I don't trust my husband. He lacks perspective, and emotionally blackmails into what he thinks is right from his point of view, because ""he didn't want this"". That last statement is irrelevant, as the UK has no-fault divorce now. But also, I am quite willing to argue that he's partly to blame for giving up on the marriage. I just recognised it sooner. Mediation seems to be a cheaper way for us both to hear where we stand legally from 3rd party, and air these grievances before making it legal.
3. Yes, we can get a fixed fee from a solicitor but if we found areas we disagreed on at that stage, it would incur additional fees, which could be expensive. Mediation is ¬£600 all in with this opportunity to claim back ¬£500. The mediator draws up paperwork of our agreements, which we can take to a solicitor to legalise and proceed with the divorce. There's a government scheme where we can claim a large portion of the cost back, he's a local authority keyworker, so we have a high likelihood of succeeding in this.

The lady my mother spoke to claims she is only paying ¬£250 for her portion of her divorce. When the government application fee is ¬£593, I don't see how that can be correct? She's offered to talk to me but I can't really handle that with my stress levels and ADHD. 

I scoured the internet for this information on more than one occasion and spoke to solicitors, friends and mediators before going this route. I've put together all the documents, spreadsheets and childcare rota information (my husband has done nothing).

Can anyone from the UK currently tell me if my assumptions on the above are correct? And I have understood what I can do for my particular situation? I'm more than hacked off at my mother for not recognising how untrustworthy my husband is, especially when she's been the one wary of him all along - sigh.

"So I feel great in my dress but it's not what I was originally looking for, in fact it was everything I didn't want. I didn't want a big ball gown, I don't like tulle, I didn't want cleavage, I wanted a timeless elegant vibe. But I fell in love with this dress which is a big-girly-princess-tulle ball gown. It seems very polarizing. Some people love the dress on me and some really don't like it.   


I loved it the moment I saw myself in it, but then all these things I didn't want to be part of my day really ate me up. Generally, I am a very decisive person who really does know what they like and why they like something.  So I'm here on Reddit now looking for honest opinions.   


Don't worry about my feelings, I just need to know what your first impressions are and what you feel overall about it on me.  


I do love it but I have concerns. Some friends who I value their style and opinions has mentioned that it looks kind of cheap with all the tulle, the cleavage is too distracting, the price point (2400 USD) could  be used on a higher quality dress, my original goals of being timeless and polished aren't met. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the positive side some opinions say I just look so happy compared to all the other dresses, it's very figure flattering, the photos will look amazing with all the added drama from the tulle.

"Went to three dress shops. Two in a major city (but not overly fancy) and one in a smaller town

‚Äî- 

Online said: bring heels if you plan on wearing heels!

My experience: they all had little platforms to stand on. I was barefoot the entire time in all three shops. They discouraged heels (probably to avoid chance of ripping dress as well)

‚Äî-

Online said: bring bras that will work with the type of dress you envision!

My experience: every dress I tried on has built in cups. No bra needed

‚Äî-

Online didn‚Äôt say anything about being topless around the woman working with you (though I didn‚Äôt research extensively)

My experience: I was half naked in front of two of the three woman. The first two places I stood there in the changing room in a thong and no bra while they unzipped the dress and got ready for me to step into. The third place the woman stood outside the room and handed me dresses to put on partway then she would come in and finish zipping me up

‚Äî-

Online said: take lots of pictures!

My experience: two of the three places let us take pictures. One place forbade it but my mom snuck some 

‚Äî-

Other things that didn‚Äôt match up with what I had in my head to expect

1. The woman working with me at one of the places was grouchy and seemed like she was probably working this job part time until she found something she actually wanted to do. She told me she doesn‚Äôt really wear dresses and was not excited or fun. It was my first place so it was a bit of a buzzkill. 

2. No one cried when I walked out in my first dress. It wasn‚Äôt the most beautiful dress but I was expecting myself or my mom or FMIL to at least tear up. Not sure why? But putting on the dress didn‚Äôt make me feel like a beautiful bride or even that special. I eventually found one that did but I was kind of expecting the first dress to work some kind of magic (I blame TV)

3. I read a lot of posts online that said ‚ÄúI bought the very first dress I tried on!!!‚Äù. I did not. It was a dress at the third place. Probably tried on 25 total?

4. For me, two appointments one day and one the next was perfect. I learned a LOT on that first day and knew exactly what I was looking for going into the second day. I was exhausted afterwards but it was nice to keep the momentum going.

"In summary - at the end of December I told my sister in law (bride to be) that I would be a bridesmaid for her wedding. I told her at the same time that I couldn‚Äôt attend the bachelorette unless it was before the end of July because I‚Äôm starting medical school. Fast forward to this month when she says the bachelorette party is the second week of August. I reminded her again that I couldn‚Äôt attend due to being in full swing of classes at that time. She then texted me a novel about how unreasonable I am and how ‚Äúit‚Äôs literally the end of the week.‚Äù She went on to talk about how it‚Äôs not hard to balance working and having a life. She followed it up with how it was ‚Äúso hurtful‚Äù I didn‚Äôt attend her baby shower previously years ago because I was taking the medical college admission exam (7.5 hours long) I didn‚Äôt reply to these so the following day she had my brother ask me. I sent her a long genuine message about the time commitment with medical school, how time is a sacrifice and how I wanted her to have a great event. I even offered to remove myself from the bridal party if she didn‚Äôt want me in it. I sincerely apologized even. She then replied ripping me a new one about how ‚Äútelling this was‚Äù about who I am as a person and how if I cared about her I would make it work. At this point I didn‚Äôt reply because I felt extremely hurt and just didn‚Äôt have anything else to say. Am I being unreasonable?

"I haven‚Äôt loved him in so long. I haven‚Äôt loved him since around 2 years prior to divorcing him. It‚Äôs been 9 years since the divorce. Our son is 11. That means I haven‚Äôt loved him a day of our son‚Äôs life. He wasn‚Äôt helpful with the baby or around the house. Once I had to leave our screaming baby son next to his head and leave the house, just because I needed to save my sanity and that was the only way to force him to get up and be a dad at night. He treated me like a full time maid, cook and babysitter all while also expecting me to go to work to pay half the bills. 

He was mean about my weight. When I got seconds, he would goad me about it to the point where one day, I just threw away my plate of food and balled my eyes out in the bedroom, while he turned the sports on the tv up louder to drown out my cries (this happened every single time I had something to cry about).

Those were only two of my many negative experiences with your husband. 

We were young (19f and 22m), too young to truly know each other, too young to have a kid together. Too young to know ourselves. At least I know I was. When your husband and I split up, I went to therapy and he jumped into a fresh relationship with you while we were still in the middle of negotiating our divorce terms. 

You didn‚Äôt know any of it yet. He didn‚Äôt tell you was married. He didn‚Äôt tell me he was dating. 

He made you think you had just met this wonderful single dad with a big heart and that his had an absent mother. He made you feel like the only woman in the world. He‚Äôs good at that when he wants to be. 

6-8 months into your relationship, you find out he‚Äôs married and that his divorce date is around the corner. I still don‚Äôt know about you at this point! A week before the divorce date, I slept with your boyfriend. Once. It was awful. It was what I needed to remind me that the divorce was the right thing. It was stupid. It was a waste of a sexual experience. I was breaking up my family and I just wanted to be sure I was doing the right thing. Your boyfriend treated me in the bedroom the same as in life - he was a selfish lover who just made me feel like a bag of meat he needed to stick his penis into every now and then. 

He wanted me back. He was trying to ‚Äúbehave‚Äù around me, trying to reignite flames that had long burnt out for me. It‚Äôs like he didn‚Äôt think I would actually go through with the divorce. I had no family support so he thought I would rely on him forever. He said ‚Äúwhat will you do without me?‚Äù and when I struggled financially he said ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have left me, you have too much pride‚Äù. In a weak moment, I thought *maybe he is right after all* and I slept with him. 

It was 5 minutes of him thrusting while I cried tears he couldn‚Äôt see because I was flipped on my stomach. 

When I still would not take him back after that, that‚Äôs when we learned about each other. 

You didn‚Äôt find out about him sleeping with me until a couple years later, right after you married him. I‚Äôm not sure how you found out but you did. 

You were so upset. When you confronted me about it, you didn‚Äôt seem to believe me when I told you it was completely meaningless to me. You were just upset that you weren‚Äôt ‚Äúa big enough freak‚Äù for your husband like ‚ÄúI was‚Äù (because apparently that‚Äôs what your husband told you). I wish I would have went into more graphic detail then but I just didn‚Äôt think of doing that back then. It just kills me that when you think of that moment of us together, you think of some crazy love making session, when I just silently cried the entire time. 

This was back when we were still trying to navigate each other. I was trying to prove to you that I wasn‚Äôt the POS absent mother your husband tried to make me out to be just because I would ask ‚ÄúWhat time are you picking up [our son‚Äôs name]‚Äù? Your husband would tell you I was bugging him to pick up our son because I didn‚Äôt want to spend time with him, but all I was doing was trying to plan my schedule because I had both work and school at the time. I couldn‚Äôt just leave an entire Friday open like your husband was the cable guy showing up sometime within an 8 hour window.

But you found out about his unfaithfulness before enough time had passed that it couldn‚Äôt be ignored anymore that I was actually the main parent, even though we have 50/50 custody. From then on, your hatred for me deepened. In that moment, you still felt you had to be ‚Äúreplacement mom‚Äù rather than ‚Äúbonus mom‚Äù, and on top of that, you found out that your husband had cheated on you with me. In your eyes, I was now the devil incarnate. 

And you were ready - your biological son is very close in age to our son - you were excited to fill that perceived gap for him. You called yourself his mother on Facebook early in your marriage, and long before I was okay with that. You once baked him a birthday cake that he said he ‚Äúwanted his mommy to make‚Äù (I know because you told me, you sent me the picture of the cake he liked, I told you I would pay someone local to do it because I wasn‚Äôt a baker nor an artist). But you still saw me through that ‚Äúbad mom‚Äù filter your husband had placed over your eyes and you thought I was just being lazy. You thought my son didn‚Äôt have a caring enough mother to bake him a cake for his birthday.

As time went on, and our son grew, it had to become impossible for you to ignore that I was actually the main parent. Our son grew old enough to start school and was diagnosed with ADHD while also classified as gifted at the time. You had to have started to see that I was the one who took him to all of his therapy appointments, medication weigh in appointments, I was the one who fielded school phone calls, parent teacher conferences, and emails staying in contact with the teachers throughout the year. I was the one who was active in his treatment while your husband just followed whatever I did because he didn‚Äôt want to pick up a phone and ask the pediatrician/therapist/teachers questions. Because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the reason he pays child support‚Äù. 

Fast forward all of these years later. You and I haven‚Äôt spoken since 2020. I had really tried so long to have more of a joint parenting situation, and you always wanted the divorce to be more traditional. The 50/50 set up seemed to unnerve you. We even went on a couple of ‚Äúmom dates‚Äù together, once just me and you to a paint/wine night, and another time on a ‚Äúmommy son date night‚Äù to Chick Fil A and ice cream. 

Both times felt so forced. You looked forced to be there. Like someone was cranking your arm behind your back just to smile when I was being friendly and talkative. 

And then we would be like that for a while - sometimes you and I would sort of get along and communicate about our son. Once, you slipped to me out of frustration when picking up our son that your husband made you feel like a babysitter. Another time, you called me to ask me for help with how our son was treating you. You asked me to ‚Äútalk to him‚Äù. Which I did, of course. But I later found out from your now-former SIL that our son was treating you like crap because your husband was treating you like how he had treated me. Your husband was allowing my son to speak to you badly because our young son would want to stick up for his dad when he heard you fighting. And so when our son would ‚Äúside‚Äù with his dad, his dad would allow him to do that. You were being ganged up on. 

Much later on, the last time we spoke, you finally told me that all the times you had pretended to be friends with me was just that - pretend. You were only doing it to make your husband happy, you said. You called me a ‚Äúdumbass cunt‚Äù on the day I delivered my twins, my husband‚Äôs first children, our ‚Äúour babies‚Äù, because you had found out that you were pregnant again (you had already one ‚Äúour baby‚Äù with your husband) and your husband was blowing up my phone to lower child support, even though it hadn‚Äôt been touched for 7-8 years and was lower than the court would have ordered it back then. An child support agreement we both came to with one lawyer for a mediator. A fixed amount that I never put in a child support review to get raised. I told your husband that I wouldn‚Äôt be bullied into lowering child support, and to basically leave me the hell alone because I couldn‚Äôt even go to the bathroom without help yet. I was still shaking off the epidural. 

Yesterday, I dropped off our son after picking him up for a couple to go to my in laws for an Easter family event. Your husband still tries to be friends. He smiled and tried to joke with me through my closed car window while I watched you not be able to even look in my direction as you struggled with the car seat and diaper bag while your husband was being weird. I could feel you dying inside all the way from my car. I want to scream at him right then and there I AM NOT YOUR FRIEND because he keeps trying to be friends with me. More than just talking about our son - there are so many examples - the most recent one was Saturday - calling me while you two made Indian food together for the first time because he thought you guys were missing a spice ‚Äúthat he knew [my name] would have because she cooks a lot‚Äù. 

He laughed and joked about it on the phone - from your end it must have sounded like we were having a happy conversation but on my end, I just stayed completely silent while he made his joke about cooking Indian food (I was just waiting for him to stop talking) and I was deadpan when I  replied to him ‚ÄúOkay. Well, I will see you later when I pick up our son. Bye.‚Äù 

He‚Äôs done this for years. Be HCBD and then turn around and try to be friends with me. It‚Äôs finally starting to even drive my husband crazy and he has always just stayed out of it because he trusted me to handle it. Earlier on, I tried to entertain it because I wanted joint birthday parties and had dreams of this model co parenting situation that minimized the damage to our son from being a child of divorce. Every time your husband would decide to be randomly nice to me, I would think ‚ÄúOh good, is this when the co parenting starts?‚Äù and I would be friendly back, only for things to go to complete shit at the first disagreement. 

Finally my husband was the one who helped snap me out of it after the millionth cycle of this. Your husband and I would never be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. You and I would never be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. I always thought maybe that‚Äôs how it had to be for a good co parenting relationship to happen but it just wasn‚Äôt going to happen that way. My husband finally told me ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs playing with you, he has no real interest in getting along‚Äù. It took 4 years for my husband to tell me that after observing for a while how your husband acted towards me. 

So I opened my eyes and he was right - your husband WAS just playing with me. He likes to try to get attention from me, for some odd reason, even all these years later, even after we both remarried with more kids. He has no real interest in co parenting our special needs kid. He always just defers to me on all the ‚Äúboring‚Äù parenting stuff (our son‚Äôs continuing treatment plans, meetings with teachers at school, etc.)

With this new perspective, I finally stopped being friendly back. If your husband texted me something unrelated to our son, I would just say ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù or ignore his text completely. If he tried to joke and be friendly with me in person, I stayed only cordial, and refused to engage like I would in the past. 

But it seems like me doing this makes your husband try even harder to be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with me. He tries to banter with me, like we are good ol‚Äô buddies. The more I don‚Äôt banter back, the more it seems that he tries. 

If I try to call him out on it, he gets super pissy and is even harder to work with as a co parent (which doesn‚Äôt actually feel like co parenting but we still have to communicate because he still takes our son 50% of the time). And when he‚Äôs being a dick, it adds stress to my life which adds stress to my marriage. So I‚Äôve stopped calling him out on it and have just not been engaging with him, except as it involves our son. 

I wish I could tell you all of this but you won‚Äôt believe it. You are now thoroughly convinced, by your husband and MIL, that I am the scourge that walks this earth. It doesn‚Äôt help that our politics and beliefs are completely opposite. I‚Äôm an atheist while you are devoutly religious, I‚Äôm very liberal while you‚Äôre very conservative, you didn‚Äôt like that I taught our son about LGBT stuff a year ago, and that I‚Äôve started talking to him about sex ed topics as he‚Äôs turned 11 and is now in middle school. You found out a couple years ago that I came out openly bisexual and talked our son about it. I don‚Äôt live a polyamorous life so my marriage still looks heteronormative but it was just so important to me that our son knew I wasn‚Äôt ashamed of my sexuality. 

The stitch is our son talks to your son‚Ä¶.you aren‚Äôt ready for your 12 year old to learn about all this stuff yet. You homeschool your son while I send our son to public schools, something you are very against doing. Something you tried to once convince me out of (you wanted to be in charge of homeschooling our son). 

Then I got our son the COVID vaccine and I think that‚Äôs the last thing that did it for you. You have been an anti vax nurse long before having a vaccine stance was popular. 

But while we have all of these surface level differences, the times that we did hang out were nice I thought. We both were fiercely outspoken women who loved our oldest sons more than anything else in the world (prior to our new kids). We both loved things like living out in the country, outdoor activities, cooking and exercising. 

I don‚Äôt ever see hope for us at this point, SM. And that‚Äôs okay. We don‚Äôt have to ever talk again, after the things you said to me on my twins day of birth, I‚Äôm happy to never speak to you again. 

But I‚Äôm a woman too. And I‚Äôm a mom too. And I‚Äôm a wife too. And I see you. I see your pain. I don‚Äôt wish ill on you. I wish your husband didn‚Äôt treat you like shit. I wish you didn‚Äôt see me as such a threat - I wish your husband didn‚Äôt make it so you still see me as a threat. I wish I could just tell you that your husband and I, I repeat, ARE NOT FRIEND AND NEVER WILL BE EVER. 

I count down the days until I can finally cut him off and block him like I have done any other person who has hurt me in my life. Your husband is a pervasive presence in my life that I have grown to tolerate due to its necessity but I get more and more impatient to put him completely out of my life the more and more I‚Äôm forced to be in contact with him. 

I just wish you knew all this, SM. I wish that you knew that while you and I don‚Äôt see eye to eye, I still wish the best for your relationship with our son because his success is the most important thing to me in all of this, and the more parental figures he has a good relationship with, the better his chances for success in life. 

I could probably keep typing. There‚Äôs so many years to type about. But I‚Äôve got to go start the day and I want to some time to myself before the kids wake up. 

I hope you read this. I don‚Äôt know if you even use Reddit but if you do, I hope you read this. You deserve better than your husband. So so much better. I‚Äôm not the threat to your marriage - your husband is. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm so so so sorry he treats you the same way he treated me. 

I hope one day you find happiness. At the same time, I don‚Äôt want you to because that would mean you leaving your husband and putting our son in yet another broken family situation. But from one woman to another, I know you aren‚Äôt a bad person and you deserve happiness, SM. My biggest wish is that you both go to therapy one day and your husband does a huge turnaround for you. 

Thanks for reading all. Sorry so long. Sorry for any typos, I won‚Äôt be able to read over this and edit until later. I‚Äôm sorry if something doesn‚Äôt make sense.

"I looked through some posts and noticed that the last ones mentioning a bounce house were around three years ago so would like more recent feedback. Any more recent brides/grooms include one for their reception or anyone attend a wedding with one recently? My reception will have children welcome (ages 2-14) and will be held outside at a large property in May. It is cocktail attire with white, ivory, and champagne colors with black accents. For florals it will be white roses and tropical greens and a minimalist art deco-esque feel. Because of the slightly minimalist feel with opulent art deco touches (think gilded mirror signs, print font, and pearl accents) my fiance is worried it will look out of place. It is all white (reference picture included) and I think would be fun for both kids and adults but would like to hear others thoughts before talking to my coordinator of where we would put it, as it is certainly within budget.

I have been married for 6 years and about 8 months ago I decided it was best to go our separate ways. 
It has been really hard living together ever since.

Him and my son have a great relationship. They like the same video games, sports etc. They do a lot together..I. my problem is that when things are fine, my husband always reassures me he will always be part of his life and even suggested going through the adoption process like we had planned. I felt very relieved and happy for my son. I always made it a point that their relationship was separate from ours and I want to respect that. But when we argue it's always the opposite. He's currently saying he is moving to a different state, him and my son had a whole summer planned with sports and when I brought this up he said it's not his fault I want to end the marriage. And he's also saying I can talk to him on my own if that's what I want to do. I just can't believe you can play with a kid's emotions like that. What am I supposed to tell him? Oh turns out your step dad didn't really love you after all because he's willing to use you to put me down. 

Always back and forth with this man. My son is going to be heartbroken and that is honestly the hardest part about this divorce. I feel like he's gonna hate me for taking him away from him.

The only thing that was stopping her was a physical travel barrier and COVID, he lives in another country otherwise it would have probably happened earlier.

So today I was on YouTube and I saw a video on her channel I didn't have her as a sub I guess YouTube just wanted to gut punch me. She made a music video with this guy, it still makes my blood boil to be honest. I have now blocked the channel.

I would never have any interaction with her ever again if I could, but we have a son so that's not possible. I will never be able to forgive her, because of all the lies, all the sacrafice I made for our relationship - the biggest one being relocating to her country, something I can no longer go back on without giving up my son.

There was just so much deciet, and the way she went about it in my eyes makes her a really shitty person.

Never been gifted anything on birthday,  anniversary, valentina etc. I make twice his salary, pay every single bill of the house, cats, cars, child(4yrs), groceries,  literally everything. I've been asking for separation for three years. He apologizes and I believe him like an idiot. I'm hurt and feel like I'm being emotionally and financially abused. I look good for my age, go to gym, have a good job and aim to achieve more. Due to his constant rejection and humiliation and lack of any intimacy I slept with couple of men. Used protection, fake identity. Basically covered all my bases bc desperation . Told him and no reaction.  He said he is hurt but wants to stay with him bc this life is too good to be thrown away to mess with separate housing and visitation. I have no savings bc my entire salary is spent on bills. He has plenty of savings bc he doesn't spend. I've cried, pleaded, gotten angry, asked nicely to please divorce bc my life is getting ruined. I deserve to be loved and cared for.

"I started reading this sub a year ago when I found out my wife was having an affair. We have been married 8 years, and have a six year old son. While I never posted out of shame and embaresment it helped me a lot and has continued to do so since then. 

At the time i found she was having multiple emotional affairs and sexinting with men online, went out on a date with one that was local but claims to have not done anything and flew to another city to ""visit a friend"" which I found out was an excuse to hook up with someone. It was hard, and I forgave her and I thought we were moving on.

One of the conditions I had was that she had to cut contact with those people, and stop using her preferred platform for finding these men (kik). We were in marriage councilng for about eight months until every session turned into how I should be ok with her resuming contact with those men and using Kik again, and that I should trust her. I wasn't ok with it, refused to be ok with it so the therapist dropped me. My wife still sees her weekly for individual. 

These things did end up happening, and I trusted her at the time but I was wrong.

About a month ago she started acting strange so I lied and told her ""I know what's going on, please just tell me"" she admitted she was involved in another online affair. She told me she had been spending her time sending nudes to guys on kik again and was planning meetups. She asked me for an open marriage, I said no. She refused to end what she was doing. I spent the last month trying to come to grips with that and was starting to at least accept this. At least I still had her at all, and had my family.

Then two days ago things were as normal, and I get a random message of my wife's naked body and saying she should be more careful who she sends nudes to. I showed her and she flipped out. Instantly she accused me of buying a new phone to send myself the messages, and of harrasing her online for days about her nudes. I dont know what happened to her or why she thinks i did anything. She asked to look at my phone and checked everything including google activity logs, but since there was nothing decided i had a second phone. She called me insane, took our son and left to stay with her sister. I still don't know who sent it or how they got my contact info (they got my name wrong) but if you know my wife's info it's not hard to find me from that.

Since then she has moved all of her and my sons things out of our house, won't let me see him and has made it clear we are done. I'm just sitting here now in a empty house that was once our home just days ago, feeling utterly and entirely lost and just feeling like I can't go on.

"Just got engaged! Trying to wrap my head around this whole wedding planning thing.

We're a pretty non-traditional couple so originally I was thinking we were going to elope. Especially since we're both very budget conscious and would definitely rather blow loads of money on a great honeymoon than a wedding. The last wedding I was part of a mutual friend officiated with about 8 other friends to party into the evening with, to give you an idea of what we're like.

But, there's a part of me that loves to throw a great party and we're very friend/community energy focused. So why not try to do something a little more special that is meaningful to us? We've got at least 50-80ish friends (most local) who would love to attend such an informal wedding. They're an incredibly friendly, down to earth, creative fun loving bunch. However I'm the kind of guy who can be a bit of a perfectionist and wouldn't want to finish the evening feeling like I could have done better.

We've got some very close friends who definitely have space to host such a group, and I'm not worried about entertainment for the evening or anything like that. But was has me worried is food.

Traditional wedding catering, while not only not being ""our style"" of wedding, seems exorbitantly expensive. I also recognize potluck style would be a bit of a pain for this size. Not only is the location a couple hours drive away for most people, but I'd hate to spend the whole wedding worrying about food logistics and timing.

Is there some kind of ""third option"" that exists? I suppose there's always ordering a lot of pizza but I feel like I could do better and that doesn't completely solve the logistics issue of food staying hot or appetizing, or even how to deal with drinks. I've never had to even think about ""catering"" for anything before. Does anyone have experiences doing a non-traditionally catered wedding? And what kind of costs were there involved with how you handled food at your off-beat wedding?

I'm almost afraid to throw out a budget since it'd be pretty darn small (again, we'd rather put money towards a honeymoon) and very not set in stone.","Non-traditional friends-only gay backyard wedding, mostly locals.

"My whole life I‚Äôve had physically demanding jobs. All union but non skilled labor non trade work. At the beginning of my divorce my ex was using the fact that she worked from home as an excuse why she should get full custody because she was more readily available for the kids if they needed her at a moment‚Äôs notice. The stress from that wreaked havoc on my mental health along with the stress of the divorce and separation in general. Along with that there were problems with my job because they didn‚Äôt want to work with accommodating my schedule for when I‚Äôd need to pick up the kids from school and so on and so forth despite the fact that they initially told me they would.

After speaking with my doctor about all the stress I was dealing with and my attempts to manage it she recommended I try finding another job. She was concerned that the stress was going to cause more serious health issues for my overall. That, paired with the fact that my job was backing out our agreement to work with my schedule as needed caused me to look for alternate work opportunities. Thankfully I was able to find a work from home job but at a pretty drastic pay cut. Prior to the job change my ex and I made roughly the same income with her making a thousand or two more than I did last year. My new salary with this job is $19000 less than what I made at my previous job. Granted, my salary at my old job was hourly and largely boosted due to overtime.

That being said, my concern is that my attorney initially told me that if I mentioned the job change that the court would then penalize me for the income I ‚Äúcould be making‚Äù at my old job. Has anyone experienced this?

"So when my brother was in high school/college he played a lot of jazz music with one of his friends who also happens to be a good friend of mine.

Although I'm not sure how much because Calvin and my brother often did impromptu shows at events so they're definitely comfortable playing together and they still play together regularly just for fun.  They would have to transport their instruments which would be a huge hassle because pianos are not easy to move.

"My god, I can't believe we're three months out already!

* July 31, 2021: My initial reach out to caterer - told her info about our wedding and what we were looking for
* August 2, 2021: I emailed her again to include that we are a client of my planner - I forgot to include that in the initial email and planner told me to let her know
* August 2, 2021: Caterer responds with she may or may not be available, but she asked if she could get back to me Sunday (August 8)
* August 2, 2021: I let her know that would be great
* August 12, 2021: I email her to check in and see if she knows if she has availability
* August 21, 2021: Planner emailed me to let me know caterer told her that she can do our catering. Planner said caterer would contact us within the next week.
* September 15, 2021: I email caterer to confirm she will be doing our catering, as planner said she would in August. 
* September 15, 2021: Caterer says she is sorry she hasn‚Äôt gotten back to us, but yes she will do our catering and she‚Äôll get back to us next week.
* September 15, 2021: I thank caterer and hope all is well with her.
* January 17, 2021: I email caterer and wish her a happy new year. I tell her we are excited to work with her and to let us know what she needs from us going forward. 
* February 10, 2021: Caterer emails that she is sorry for the delay and that she just realized she tried to forward us the menu but it was still in her outbox and just realized it this morning. 
* February 10, 2021: I thank her and let her know my fianc√© and I will look the menu over and get back to her within the next week.
* February 17, 2021: We email her with our menu options we would like and some questions.
* April 4, 2021: I email her to see what she needs from us moving forward. 

Meanwhile, our planner has been apologizing she hasn't getting back to us. I think the only reason the caterer has emailed when she does is because the planner puts a bug in her ear. I'm beyond frustrated. At this point, I just want food at my wedding and I really don't care what it is.

"Do I really need a planner?

My wedding is set for June 27th 2022. My partner of 17 years and I are having it this summer because my mother is not doing well health wise. There are 50ish guests of family and friends that all mix well (no family drama anywhere)

We don‚Äôt like the idea of things being a big show/production. We‚Äôre not having bridesmaids/groomsmen and possibly not doing speeches over dinner even. So Im trying to figure out exactly why I need a Planner, or a Coordinator.

Im trying to keep the budget under 10K

Things I‚Äôve already booked/know what I want:

Venue

Officiant

Entertainment

Furniture Rental (Chairs and couches)

Things I Still need to do:

Decide on the caterer and the overall meal experience

Hire a photographer

Make a playlist

Decide on table settings/center pieces (All of which I want really simple)

&amp;#x200B;

Do I really need to hire a Wedding planner at this point? No matter what I do, Im still going to have to have an in-depth discussion with either the caterer or a planner about what food I want, so why not just skip the middle man? I still need to go there and do a tasting, so where is the time savings here?

So Far I‚Äôve seen average cost of wedding planner is $5k.

I see the average cost for event coordinating is $2K

The Venue comes with a Venue Coordinator and they have 2 preferred caterers who would know the drill with the space.

Should I just go with one of those and forgo a coordinator as well?

I see this event being very casual and don‚Äôt really feel the need for it to be a perfectly smooth seemless production that is super pomp and circumstance-y? There‚Äôs not going to be a rehearsal or anything. Like if I had a backyard, it would be in the backyard you know what I mean?

But I honestly haven‚Äôt been to that many weddings. I don‚Äôt know all the ins and outs. I don‚Äôt know what can go wrong. But I feel like nothing is really that big of a deal.

Is the coordinator kinda just there to tell the caterer to start the dinner service? Cuz I can get my cousin to handle that.

I feel like I can't get a straight answer about what a coordinator has to offer me because either people just hear that you need to have one, so assume you need to have one. Or it's co-ordinators trying to emotionally blackmail into hiring them because you need them to: ""Make sure everything runs smooth"" ""Make sure nothing goes wrong"" ""Make it seemless"" ""Take all the pressure off you"" ""Make's your perfect day more perfect"" ""Let's you enjoy your big day"". LIKE PLEASE CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO THOUGH?

I'm working with experienced Caterers that know the space, A venue that does hundreds of events each year, A decor rental place that does this every day, and a photographer that knows what they're doing. Do I really need to pay $2000-5000 for someone to talk to these people for me?

So what do you think!? Do I need a planner? Do I need a Coordinator? Or should I just get my cousins to help me with some things on the day of cuz they just want to anyway? I don't want to be naive and not understand how beneficial that person might be so if you have any advice lemme know.

"My FH and I are searching for venues to host a micro wedding with a current guestlist of 50. Budget is $40-50k. We are both very open minded and adventurous. We live in the midwest and will travel anywhere in the continental US. We are not tied down to any specific region- we‚Äôre just looking for a location that can comfortably accommodate our guests and fit our vibe. Our dream is to find a venue with lodge/cabins that can comfortably accommodate all 50 guests in a close proximity for a 4 day/3 night intimate experience. Being able to have the ceremony and guest lodging on the same grounds without outside distractions is our primary goal. We don‚Äôt want to be confined to a strict itinerary or venue time limit. Our vision for the weekend includes being in nature (+ for mountains/cool trees, lakes, etc), food and booze, overall just a fun time for our family and friends to hang out together. Most places we see say they can accommodate 50+ guests, but have 3+ beds or multiple bunk beds to a room with inadequate bathrooms/toilets. We are ideally trying to find a location with private cabin suites where guests can have their own bathroom and privacy. Are we crazy for thinking this is possible?

TLDR: Budget $40-50k, Guests 50, ISO venue/property buyout in nature that can accommodate guests comfortably with mostly private couples rooms and bathroom facilities. Can be anywhere in continental US.  

Thank you all so much for your help!",ISO: Venue for micro wedding buyout,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning
"I am feeling really bad. I originally didn‚Äôt want to do a Bach party, or just do a night out because I didn‚Äôt want to impose the expense on my bridesmaids, but my sisters and future sister in law convinced me that we should go on a trip; we decided to take advantage of low prices on cruises and take a Bahamas cruise. My parents have airline credit cards and graciously offered to cover our flights with their points, as they have not been doing any flying since the start of the pandemic. 

My other 3 bridesmaids/friends were given a total no obligation invite, I would have loved if they could come but I totally understand if they couldn‚Äôt/didn‚Äôt want to spend the money, and we could do a night out together locally. 

They all declined, two didn‚Äôt want to spend the money and the other had a baby last year and isn‚Äôt comfortable leaving her yet.

I don‚Äôt know if this is a normal thing but I feel that my whole personality has changed after divorce and I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôve become some kind of psychopath or something.

Lots of the changes are positive, greater self esteem, more confidence, less anxiety etc but the flip side to that is that I feel that I just don‚Äôt care about things anymore, I feel like I‚Äôve got much less empathy, I‚Äôm more pessimistic, I don‚Äôt have time for things I used to enjoy, I don‚Äôt seem to feel heightened emotions.

Specific examples are that I was vegan for 10 years and was passionate about animals but since the divorce, I just don‚Äôt care and I‚Äôm slowly slipping off the veganism. I was terrified of flying and would cry whenever I was on a plane but now I feel nothing and regularly fly alone. In fact, I took up flying lessons in a tiny plane and felt basically nothing, no anxiety, no thrill etc. I used to be passionate about saving money but now I just spend everything I have every month. 

At first I let myself off but it‚Äôs been 7 months since the separation (13 years together and divorce finalised in Jan 2022). The circumstances of the split were that he woke up one day and just left with no warning or conversation, I didn‚Äôt see it coming at all and I thought we were happy. He‚Äôs now in a relationship with one of my work friends.

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if everything that happened actually traumatised me in some way and now I‚Äôm not capable of feeling. I love 90% of this new person I‚Äôve become but I do worry about the lack of empathy or caring.

"Reddit is the only place I feel safe to openly talk about my divorce, and be completely vulnerable about it.

This week, I sold my wedding ring. I had to do it. I need to trust God that He will bring me someone who is better for me. But oh my God, selling the ring triggered a lot of emotions. Emotions of joy as I remembered him giving it to me in the book store, emotions of happiness as I remember the first time I wore it, so excited, so blessed. Remembering when I showed it to my friends, family and even colleagues. I remember the glow on my face. Feelings of heartbreak when he told me it was over, feeling of shame as I had to share the news with everyone, feeling of pain, anger, sadness etc...

I'm not proud to say this, but last year I would sometimes still wear my ring as I slept. It was such a small piece of jewelry, the only piece of authentic jewlery I ever had (other than the gifts I received at the time of the wedding which I returned to my ex as he requested). It meant so much to me. I went to different jewellers who would look at the license and the value, until I finally sold it to a chinese man in a sketchy shop. I told my brother to leave as I gave the box with the ring. I looked at the Chinese man, and began crying. I felt a sense of pain, I do not know why. I forgive my ex completely and I even pray sometimes that God will give him a lot of success and happiness. I do not wish for him to experience the sadness I experienced during this process. But it was so painful. I've committed to selling or deleting every reminder of our relationship. I want to reclaim my heart, reclaim my life.

When I went home, I felt at ease. Fresh, happy and excited for the future. I felt free. I played the piano all evening. Selling the ring, was an important step.",Sold my ring and wedding dress over a year later,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,weddingplanning,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce
"This coming weekend will be one year since my now ex-husband moved out. I‚Äôm still trying to deal with the grief because I‚Äôm one of those people that just keeps going regardless of the situation. I accomplish this by suppressing emotional pain. For years I tried to express the hurt of his words and actions to him. I got nowhere. He turned it back around on me and made himself the victim. So, I stopped trying and just survived. I didn‚Äôt leave when I should have because I felt an obligation to make it work.  I wanted to honor the commitment. That was my mistake. It takes two to honor a commitment. I wish I had felt I could let go sooner. 
He has wanted to be friends after our divorce. After everything was legally final, I realized I couldn‚Äôt do that. I can‚Äôt be friends with someone that showed such little regard for me. He wants this to relieve his own guilt, because if we‚Äôre friends, it means everything is okay. We‚Äôve been on an ‚Äúas needed‚Äù communication basis the past year. 
He recently texted that he hoped we could be friends again. I did not respond. We‚Äôve already had this conversation, and me trying to express how I was hurt only produced the same defensiveness and victim mentality from him. This was many months ago. For those of you thinking this guy is a narcissist, I think you‚Äôre correct. 
I do want closure on all this. But I don‚Äôt have much hope of getting it. I‚Äôve already explained, and yet he‚Äôs asked again, so clearly there is no more concern for my feelings now than there was before. As the one year mark rolls around, I‚Äôm considering trying again, but I‚Äôm really struggling with why. I want to be heard and acknowledged. But that isn‚Äôt a likely outcome.

"Hello everyone, just need some outside input here.

In my head, I‚Äôve chose four bridesmaids: best friend from high school (MOH), best friend from college, friend from grad school, and a friend from my current friend group.

The friend from grad school and I met in 2018. We had a really small class and we became friends on the first day. She‚Äôs so much fun and always down for anything. She was the person I hung out with the most from 2018-2021. Even after grad school, we hung out all the time. In mid-2021 she moved back to her home country in Europe permanently (I‚Äôm in US). It was sad but we still text each other all the time to update on our lives. I was supposed to go visit her this summer, but with the wedding and plane ticket prices going up, I just can‚Äôt swing it financially. 

A few years ago, before I was engaged, I told her I wanted her to be one of my bridesmaids one day. She was really excited and said she would fly back for it (she always knew she would go back to Europe). Then, when I actually got engaged, I told her and she was still really excited and said she was marking her calendar. 

I really want her to be in my wedding, I miss her so much! Despite living in another country, she already knows a bunch of my friends, and she gets along great with everyone she meets.

However, I‚Äôm worried that asking her to be a bridesmaid is too much. If I couldn‚Äôt afford to fly out to visit her, how can I expect her to fly here and spend money on a dress, accommodations, transportation, etc?? I‚Äôd love to be able to cover some of that for her, but I don‚Äôt want to be unfair to my other bridesmaids, and our budget is already stretched so thin. I want to check in and see if she is still willing to make the trip, but I don‚Äôt want her to feel pressured to go by introducing the bridesmaids aspect.

Additionally, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be able to go to any of the fun bridal activities (bachelorette, shower, dress shopping). I don‚Äôt want her to feel left out, but logistically, she can‚Äôt fly out here every time! All of my other bridesmaids live near me.

Basically, I want her to be part of my wedding because I love her and she‚Äôs still one of my best friends, but I don‚Äôt want her to be pressured to make a big financially straining trip just to make me happy. I know she was on board a few years ago, but circumstances change!

i finally come across one girl on instagram who does the style we‚Äôre looking for, she‚Äôs in budget, &amp; available on our date. perfect. on March 13, we chat for awhile on instagram talking about the details. after we confirm everything, i tell her i would like to book with her. she reads my message &amp; doesn‚Äôt reply. March 14 comes &amp; goes &amp; she still hasn‚Äôt replied. i message her again on March 17 asking if i can put a deposit down to save our date - she reads my message almost immediately &amp; no reply. March 18 &amp; 19, no reply. 

so at this point, i feel like i‚Äôm wasting time because im not expecting a reply. i start again with sending emails, instagram messages, facebook messages, etc. March 20, i‚Äôve found someone else that i‚Äôm almost certain i will book with (we have a phone consultation scheduled later this week to confirm everything) then i get a message from the instagram photographer on March 20 saying ‚Äúi can‚Äôt wait to work with you! can you please send your deposit to @venmo?‚Äù 

i tell her ‚Äúi‚Äôm very sorry but i‚Äôve already went on to find another photographer in the area that‚Äôs available on our date. i didn‚Äôt receive a reply from you for nearly a week &amp; assumed you were not ready to work with us.‚Äù

"Apologies in advance this is going to be somewhat long. I'll try and keep it as brief as possible.

I separated from my ex about 3 years ago (for the sake of clarity we'll call her ""Claire""). We were fighting constantly and it got to the point where she was regularly calling the police to falsely report that I had hurt her or our child, as a trump card to win arguments. After our breakup we coparented successfully, with a voluntary custody agreement (not court mandated, we were never legally married), until I started dating my current girlfriend (""Anna""). Anna and I had been dating for just over 6 months, and I felt it was time for her to meet my child. Up until this point Claire didn't know Anna existed, but I let Claire know I was dating someone and intended to introduce her to our child as a courtesy. Claire requested to meet Anna as she wanted to be familiar with someone who would be increasingly involved with our child, fair enough. I obliged. (Note this same courtesy was not extended to me when Claire introduced her then BF to our child earlier that year, and then later moved in with him)

Now I just want to put the disclaimer that I am not walking around saying stuff like this in my everyday life, but I will say it here to offer some context. Anna one ups Claire in almost every respect, and it is glaringly obvious. She is better educated, more emotionally intelligent, more attractive, has a solid career, has hobbies she is passionate about, is more physically fit, the list goes on. Suffice it to say, I lucked out with her.

This is where things start going wrong. Issues start slowly popping up in the months after Claire and Anna's initial meeting. All of a sudden Claire is getting ""called into work"" last minute on Friday afternoons (when it's her parenting time), and ""needs"" me to watch our kid. In and of itself, not a huge issue, happy to hang out with my kiddo. This happens a handful of times, and then the ""trips"" start happening. 3 months in a row she schedules trips, that incude the child, on my parenting weekends, but doesn't let me know until 24-72 hours before I'm scheduled to pick the child up. She then tries to completely rearrange our agreed upon schedule, so that I can ""make up my lost time"", which doesn't work on my end because I have other obligations that I had scheduled purposely so that they wouldn't conflict with my parenting time. Claire is now mad at me because I ""don't want to spend time with our kid"", which couldn't be further from the truth, but I cave, rearrange some things, and now we are on the opposite schedule we were previously (50/50 custody changing weekly). It just so happens that this schedule change coincides nicely with my ex having our child on Christmas eve/morning, after a lot of arguing, Claire and I agree that I can pick the child up at 8am on Christmas morning and return her by noon. Long story short, I show up to pick up the child and Claire is ""asleep"", and child is not allowed to open the door or wake mom up. After 45 minutes of calling she finally wakes up and I take the child. At this point I am pissed, she is clearly taking advantage, but I put up with it for the sake of my kid. The next couple of months go by and things are still contentious, but nothing major occurs. During this time Claire and her boyfriend breakup and he moves out, coincidentally within 2 weeks of Anna moving in with me.

Things are quiet until about a month after Anna moved in. I have a credit card, that is only used for bills that are consistent each month (spotify/netflix/internet, stuff like that), that is paid off in full by an auto transfer each month. For this reason, I'm not super ontop of checking my CC statement, I just do it every couple of months or so. This time when I went to check, I had about a $4000 balance that had not been paid. Turns out Claire had the CC saved on her computer and had been using it for about a month and a half.  Now I am happy to purchase things for my child, I am also happy to pay court ordered child support (which she has not pursued), I am not okay with Claire having free range of my credit card. Obviously I cancelled the card, and texted her asking what was going on. No response. I tried on several occasions to bring it up via phone, to try and find a resolution, but every time Claire just pretended I had not said anything at all, and would only communicate about logistics having to do with the child. Finally I had had enough, and when she came to pick up the child one afternoon I went out to talk to her, leaving the child indoors. I immediately asked her about the CC balance, and what her plan to pay me back was, and when she tried to ignore me yet again, I requested that she pay me at least the minimum payment each month, until the balance was paid off. She immediately responded by calling the police, reporting that I was holding her child hostage. At which point I returned our child to her, and have not communicated with or seen Claire since, but have begun the process of taking our custody battle to court. (Claire's mother and I still have a good relationship, so I have been seeing my child through her, but not as much as I would like)

All this to say, I am trying to figure out if I am dealing with a narcissist or just a jealous ex. I know this cannot be diagnosed on the internet, but I'm wondering if anyone has gone through anything similar? Is it worth trying to reconcile with Claire for our childs sake? Or is this a lost cause, and a fair reconciliation is not possible?

"I (25M) and my now ex-wife (26F) have recently separated. I was completely caught off-guard by her desire to no longer be with me, especially considering that we have a 2.5 year old son and have been friends since middle school. After a bad argument, she left and decided to notify me that we were done. She claims ""abuse"" based on an incident months ago where I grabbed her arm and moved it when she was screaming and in my face. Many of her family members, some of which I'm close with, are equally as confused as I am because 90% of the time I felt that we were a happy family.  

I had observed her mental health decay over the 3 months leading to our separation. She was increasingly anxious, very demanding, was self-harming, and began burning bridges with some of her family members and mine as well. We got a therapist but she claimed that CBT therapy did not work for her. Two weeks later she said she didn't want to be with me anymore. We made many attempts to make sure she was ok. We lived in a separate unit near my parents where we didn't have to pay rent, my mom was available all the time to help with my son, and working remotely I would often help her with many household tasks when she felt overwhelmed. 

I am completely blindsided by this. This whole experience has been extremely hard for me but I've found myself now trying to focus on how to keep my son happy and healthy.

\- What can I do to be a great single dad?

So I am doing some last minute entries to our taxes and I needed the car tax that was paid for her car last year.   She forgot to give me that info...ok no problem I will just look into our joint BOA account and find the amount....... NORMALLY I don't look into that account and just leave it be, but got the big surprise when I checked the statements and transactions recently.  I am seeing at least a dozen transactions in NY and other countries BUT I am also seeing money transfers to the guy (that she is having affairs with) AND hundreds of dollars in cash withdraws.     


Lawyer said once married, all money earned is OUR Money.  So she has access to my account and I have access to her account.   In the nearly 3 weeks she has been gone she has taken out nearly 3k.   WHAT THE F!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  I was ready to send a message asking her if she was using her debt card over there because of the possibility that her card has been compromised, but when started seeing ATM money withdrawals in the hundreds of dollars.     


I stopped my self from reaching out to her.   I spoke to our joint Bank(BOA doesn't have Live online chat support.... for real?) so I can see if they can demine if her card has been skimmed/stolen or is she actually withdrawing large amounts of cash in Germany.   BOA was useless saying that they couldn't more details to confirm that the card was actually being used in Germany or other countries (like from an IP address or something).  The only way to really look into it is to set up a fraud claim and that will take time to investigate it and they probably will shut the card off...which is not a good idea even our current situation.   


If this is indeed her spending and giving hundreds of dollars to this guy, what's my lawyer going to do with this?   She left without any cash or converted her money from US dollars to German marks.    The ATM withdraws and money transfers are big red flags to me.   I checked my account and it looks like she hasn't touched it...yet....   Now I am starting to feel like she is being that stupid that she would leave a money trail that big.   I am SO ANGRY right now.   If and when this divorce process gets started, will these actions look bad on her?  She is digging her own grave right now.  I have no idea how her lawyer is going to defend her actions like that.   Will it play in my favor when I do request additional spousal support (if she can give money to her fling, she has the money to give me more money).",Large amounts of money being withdrawn overseas by STBXW.,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,weddingplanning,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"Hello all! 

My friend has a bachelorette trip coming up in about a month. I agreed to go when the idea got brought up back in February. Now the details are starting to emerge‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs expensive (for me personally). I‚Äôve worked it out to be a minimum of $700. 

I could afford but it would *hurt* and I‚Äôm not even that close with this girl.

On top of not being particularly close with her, I am also saving up for my own wedding currently. I live in an extremely expensive city and make a pretty average income so between paying for rent/food/etc and trying to save money, there isn‚Äôt much left.

"Hi there! This is my first post on Reddit and it's a messy one. I am looking for some advice to help get me through a very emotional split from my bipolar ex. I am (26F) and he is (27M). We were married for 8 years, together for 9.

It is a long, crazy story. I met him in 2013 and we immediately began dating. We were both seniors in high school, so you can just imagine how attached we became to each other. It was quick and passionate. It did not take long for things to get toxic though. There was jealousy and insecurity. I had one prior relationship that I disclosed to him (stupidly) and he held that against me for YEARS. We are Muslim. I would say he comes from a more religious background than I do. Despite this, he had no issue getting involved with me on a sexual level. It seemed very hypocritical to me but he said he fully intended to marry me.

I disclosed to him that I would not be able to have children shortly after our relationship got serious. The only way I could have children would be through surrogacy. He took it well at first, but then said it was ""God's way of punishing me"" and that down the line he may consider a second wife. My self-worth was non-existent and instead of leaving then, I stayed with him. We broke up and got back together many times before deciding that we should just tie the knot. Stupid, I know.

Shortly after our engagement, my ex had his first full-blown manic episode. His episodes were horrifying. He would go days with no sleep, lost a lot of weight, was overly religious, and put himself in serious danger. He was diagnosed with Bipolar 1. After 2 months of mania, he somewhat stabilized. He was put on heavy doses of meds (Lithium, Depakote). I stood by him during this time. I got to know his family. I knew that I would not leave him because of this. After a few months, he discontinued his medication. His family believed it was black magic, and I naively did not know the extent of his diagnosis. We got married, went on our honeymoon, and that summer he had his second episode overseas. It was way, way worse. It took close to 4 months for him to stabilize that time around. He finally got on a steady medicine regime and things were looking up for us. My parents took us in and supported us during this time until we could afford a place on our own. It took time but we finally got our own place in 2019.

Our relationship was far from perfect, but we did love each other. I will say I feared him a bit. He did gaslight me a lot and always insulted my personality. But, I put up with it and tried my best to change. I cannot write down all of the terrible things he said to me over the years but here are a few that repeat in my mind- ""I can't imagine only being married to you"" ""You are a burden to me"" ""I feel imprisoned by you""- It leaves me dumbfounded.

I graduated from college in 2017 and started working. He took time to graduate due to the setbacks of his illness but eventually he got his degree (2020). We traveled a lot together- did a whole Europe trip. There were great moments between us. I was always there to support him. He started to take up new hobbies like biking, coding and playing video games. I was not interested but gave him the space to talk about the things he enjoyed. Then two months into the pandemic, he asked for a separation. He said he felt like we had no common interests and he found life with me was too boring. (Married now for 5 years). We talked it out but nothing changed. He said he was ok with our differences. I tried learning how to play but I just had no interest in gaming- he would do it all night and during working hours.

A few months pass and he got a warning at his job for bad performance. He decides to quit and we move to FL. I saved as much money as I could so we could settle and buy a home. And that we did. I paid for the down payment and all the renovations for our new condo. Due to many changes in employment, my ex stopped getting med refills. Turns out he was taking extremely low doses for over a year. Now things start getting weird:

August 2021- buys me a new wedding ring. Things are great.

Sep 2021- we get into an argument, he said he wants to separate and that he envisions himself with another woman. Brings up that we have nothing in common and I am not on his wavelength. I am begging him not to do this. I uprooted my whole life for him. I was completely alone in a new state. We write down goals for each other and agree to give it another shot.

Sep 2021- March 2021- we start working out consistently together. He gets fired from his high-paying job (no reaction to it, not a care in the world) and I did not say anything- I actually felt relief for him. I booked us a trip to California. It was incredibly fun. He lands a new job and we begin talking about selling our condo to buy a home!

Then suddenly after a walk last weekend, he looks at me with no emotions and says it is over. I have a full-blown panic attack. I lost feeling in my hands and arms. He sat across from me playing a game on his phone. He was emotionally checked out suddenly. He said he is tempted to cheat on me.

I went through his meds- no prescriptions are left. He said he will only take lithium orotate (over-the-counter medication) and that it is no longer my business.

I check his emails and found that he had a dating profile up. He also had a fake TikTok that he used to like lewd videos of women.

I made my father and sister come down to FL to help me pack my stuff. We had a talk with him and his father as well before I officially left. He said he was done. Not a tear, no hugs, no looking back. He walked out on our life together.

A week passes and I am back in my hometown grieving. I have lost a huge sum of money and a future I thought we had together. Now, I have had moments of doubt in my marriage but I never would have done this to him. I am leaving it to him to file divorce paperwork. Our last conversation was that he would pay me back the money I invested into the condo when it sells. He said ""you're divorced"" and we ended the call.

I am in complete shock. Luckily, I have an amazing family who is supporting me during this time but how can someone do this? How can you walk away from your partner after years together?

He was also aware that I had just applied to nursing school down in FL by our home. He let me book a whole trip to California but said ""I was thinking about being with another woman the whole time"" I also recently gave him 2 grand for a downpayment on his new car.

"I was the one who instigated the divorce. My dad was dying and I couldn't hold all his unresolved, unrealized trauma from his youth(refused to see a therapist, did a few sessions of couples therapy but was so resistant) and deal with every responsibility anymore; I was going through my own pain in losing someone important.  It was the last straw that he couldn't step up and be with my family or help during this time. 

We were in a different state then we live to take care of my dad. After i told him, he went into a depressive state of mind. I had just started grad school virtually because of the pandemic. Some days i would wake up to him in complete dark, completely incapacitated with a sheet over his head. No eating, no nothing, all day/night. Eventually I couldn't take the stress of opening the door to him in that condition. I have a lot of compassion for him and especially feel shameful for how i treated him in the moment but I felt so angry at him then. Somehow his depressive state made me angrier in that moment. It showed me he couldn't take care of himself in crisis. It scared me to go back to that.It was abrupt and coming from left field when it happened.  I asked him to leave the state we were in and go back to our apartment with the dog. 

By the time i got back to our apartment, he was still not taking care of himself, lost 15 pounds to an already severely thin body. (5'11 145lbs down to 130lbs) 

Seeing what I caused just broke me, but I still stood my ground. I didn't want to be in it anymore... For the first time in our relationship I made room for myself and let him be accountable for his own feelings. He was still hoping we could talk about it in therapy (we had been to couples therapy 2 times by ultimatum) but at that point my dad was severely ill and i had to fly back. I took care of my dad till he passed away.

The day my dad died, he called me, we both were crying on the phone, but somehow it became about him and his loss. I even asked, ""do you see how you are making this about you when i just lost one of the most important people in my life?"" He could only see his own pain. I didn't want a divorce, i just felt like i was forced to do it.  i tried so hard to work on us (he would disagree), say what i needed. I truly feel like the evil one in this dynamic, and i cant shake it. I know i gave myself a gift, but i feel such guilt that i ruined his life (he literally told me that) I cant help but care, and maybe that was the problem to begin with. Regardless of all the shit we had in our relationship,i still love him and care very deeply about him. He is a good person with a big heart, which is why i fell for him to begin with.

I guess im writing this because i only lost my dad in October. I lost the two men in my life that were my world and i still feel so much pain at the grief by both losses. Im a little ashamed because he feels as if it came from nowhere, but i have said everything i was unhappy with over and over in so many ways. He couldn't see that I had asked.

We still are working on paperwork its been about 1.5 years now. Neither of us have anything so there is no fighting. However, there is zero communication at his request. He is too hurt to even get a picture of our dog (that we got together) it makes me angry. But maybe i shouldnt expect it.

Why do i still long for him even though i know it was the right thing to do? I feel just as lonely now as i did with him, but his person is what i miss not the relationship...if that makes any sense.

"I'm at a loss. My divorce was very difficult, and I had to cohabitate with a hostile ex. I managed to get him to move out 8 months ago, and he signed all the paperwork.

I don‚Äôt have the problems most people have.  Parents have been great and have paid for everything.  My sister did a good bridal shower.  My fianc√© is an amazing and supportive person. I love my dress.

But my brother won‚Äôt be there.  He shot and killed himself last May.  I was the last person to see him alive and the first to find him dead.  In a span of 3 minutes, he went from breathing to not breathing anymore.

My fianc√© knows I feel this way.  My parents suspect I feel this way but are just shelling out money to make sure I have what I want, even though I told them to stop doing that (my parents are wealthy and can afford it so it‚Äôs more me not wanting to take advantage of them as my mom said she won‚Äôt get another wedding since my sister is married and my unmarried brother is deceased).

The closer I get to the wedding day, the more I want to vomit at the fake happy I‚Äôll be all day.  I already have PTSD from the gunshot sound and my asperger‚Äôs makes it difficult enough to not be obsessive about stuff.

Court house wedding wouldn‚Äôt make a difference.  I‚Äôm just sad because my brother won‚Äôt be here to celebrate.  I trade the whole damn this, all the way down to the engagement ring, if it meant he was still here.

But he‚Äôs not.",Struggling really bad with feeling happy about my wedding.,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,Divorce,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning

"I want a divorce because I am so tired of being emotionally, mentally, and physically abused. I'm tired of being gas lit. If he were to comment, he would say it's all me but I'm really trying to keep my head on straight and reasonable - I'm not innocent, but I am not the abuser. I'm so tired of being tortured mentally - I'm exhausted of carrying the mental load. The last few weeks I've been seriously considering filing. We gave 2 children *1 is my child he adopted (mistake) and the other is our child together. They are 6 and 3*

I make 228k, he makes 73k. I am self employed so I don't actually MAKE that much. Until this past week he has worked night shift pretty much our entire marriage. I carry the weight of all parenting responsibilities - I even pay the child support for HIS OWN CHILD. so it's safe to say that I'm the parent and he is hardly even a part time parent. 

He is scaring me to death. He keeps saying ill never get out with the kids and he will make sure I never have custody of them. I'm also afraid I will have to pay him alimony and child support. I'm so afraid he is going to take my kids. He doesn't even know the name of the medication or the dose they take (they both have a condition that requires injection nightly). I also bought my house on my own before I was married to him and he keeps saying he will take my house - even though he can have it. He's destroyed it by punching walls and door frames. I just want a safe place for me and my children again. 

Today I just snapped. I can't handle the way I'm being treated - called a bitch, talked down to, yelling at my kids, hitting things, throwing things at me. 

I am so humiliated. I'm so scared to tell my family. I'm scared to call the police out of humiliation because my dad is the assistant chief of police. I'm humiliated and I'm heartbroken. The only person I have thought of calling is technically my husband's friend- but I feel like he only sees me as a sexual conquest and while he won't tell him I don't feel like that would be in my best interest. 

(Please no religious bashing). This is against my religious beliefs as well so I'm just in absolute agony. 

I don't know what kind of advice I'm looking for here. I just feel like I want a friend to talk to or to run to so badly. I'm so embarrassed to tell anyone I know. 

I am visiting my family out of state next week and I'm seriously considering just not returning (I homeschool and work remotely). I'm also considering getting an apartment and just moving while he is at work. I wish I wasn't going out of town because he will also he out of town for work that entire week and I would have plenty of time.

I am looking for some helpful tips, advice, feedback for my 2nd wedding makeup trial.

This was done my the makeup artist at the venue so that is a factor I'm considering day of. I really like this over what I had done for our engagement party. It was so much more caked on and didn't feel like my own face so I asked her to go a lot lighter and I love the feel and overall look of it. My best friend suggested lashes (which I will be doing extensions a bit before) and a darker lip shade which I think I am partial too.

"I will be standing my ground. I am not insane I am as sane as I can be. The fact you can‚Äôt recognize me emotions coming out, and you  blatantly not giving a care has never been healthy for us. You are the most self centered person I‚Äôve ever met, even all the good things you do for people is for your conscious. You haven‚Äôt been giving me effort, like I said you have been doing the opposite. I have tried and tried every day to ‚Äúchange‚Äù for you, and I have because I knew too that I can become a better person. But not once have I seen any growth in the way you treat me or the way you even intend to treat me. I made a plan in my head and you can‚Äôt even do that. I‚Äôm tired of being pushed over this whole relationship amd you constantly telling me I‚Äôm wrong when you are emotionally abusive to me and can‚Äôt reconcile in anyway. You make me sad and mad to the core because the person I put all my love into doesn‚Äôt and hasn‚Äôt given anyfucks for years probably. You don‚Äôt care about anything I talk about. Anything that excites me, you indeed tell me to ‚Äúshut the fuck up‚Äù every time. When you get excited about something I full on pay attention and don‚Äôt tell you to shut the fuck up. I don‚Äôt care if I talk a lot, that is not mental illness, that is suppression of speech and your literally as bad at the government if not worse. I will not live in a house amd raise my kids with someone who won‚Äôt, talk, listen, or put any effort into a marriage when they fully well know what marriage entails. You have been neglecting me on purpose for so long and I‚Äôve given you so much slack, I‚Äôm fed up feeling a like bucket of volatile emotions because you make the them volatile. You can never be happy, And you don‚Äôt take any measures to even try to make yourself happier. You are absolutely stuck in mindset of taking me for granted and giving me effort. I mean what did you think was gonna happen, eventually I would just auto comply all the time and stfu? I‚Äôm a human being and you don‚Äôt treat me like one, let alone in the relationship itself. You do not treat me with respect, I am constantly building you up and you want to just tear me down. You are not the same person, and I know I‚Äôm not ether. But I gave you my first ultimatum I‚Äôve ever given you last weekend and you solved it with putting a bandaid over my feelings by having sex with me that night and making me fall back in love with you. I literally cry alone all the time because I know I am truer than I have ever been. I give so much and try so hard to be the best person for you and it‚Äôs just not enough for your standards. I hope and wish you the best and pray that the person your meant to be with doesn‚Äôt get silenced 24/7. I am sorry for letting my emotions out, that doesn‚Äôt make me mentally ill or crazy by the way. Just because your suppressing yours doesn‚Äôt make you the better person or in the right what so ever. You have been building all this up and I‚Äôm sorry you couldn‚Äôt see it even though you said it 25 time a day. I can‚Äôt be with person that has no interest in me. You have none.. it‚Äôs so easy to tell, but my personality is literally always desperate to fix anything because all I want to do is see my family thrive. I know are family isn‚Äôt going to thrive if the kids have to see me let out angry and sad emotions in a repeat cycle because you can‚Äôt give me the effort. I don‚Äôt care how we handle this, it‚Äôs completely up to you but I can‚Äôt be with you anymore. I‚Äôm really sorry I‚Äôm that it‚Äôs not working out but I think you and I both know our little family we created is more important. So if you want me to stay at my parents house that‚Äôs fine. I would not like to get lawyers and drain money we need to spend. We can be civil about this and try to come to a sound consensus.

"I've been married since 2013. I met my husband in high school and discovered I was pregnant at 17. We were just kids having kids I guess, and at the time he was hardly around. He would be out at parties or with his friends, talking to but never actually seeing other girls. When I think back on it he was just young, we both were, and I don't fault him for that. He's turned into a really great man. 

I had our son in 2012, and then in 2013 I was pregnant again. At the time we got married in the courthouse so I could be on his health insurance and it felt like the only option I had left at that point. He worked out of town weeks at a time, and now the past few years he's not had to do this. He is home almost every day.

I've worked a full time job the past 5 years, done most of the parenting, home care, lawn care, house maintenance and tried my best to finish getting my degree. I work probably on average about 50 hours a week. I'm so tired. But at this point I've stopped asking for help. If I ask for help in the morning getting them dropped off at school because I'm running behind, he will yell at all of us. He'll get angry, say I should have given him more notice, when I only asked if it's been a particularly difficult morning and I just needed a little help and he has nowhere or no time limit to be anywhere and I do. If I ask for help with something that needs fixed in our home, he will bullshit around it for weeks until I finally attempt to do it myself. There are things that he won't let me call people to fix or come look at and I'm so depressed by the state of my home and I just want to hide from him and all of it. 

During Covid I did it all while he stayed locked in a room and played video games. He didn't sleep in bed with me. He didn't spend time with his kids. I think it was at that point I realized how much I didn't like him as a person anymore.

He also seems to have an awful attitude towards our son, our first born. He constantly yells at him and tells him to shut up. I overheard him the other day telling him he would ""make his life a living hell"" and our son is only nine. I brought this up a week ago, this anger he seems to have towards him. He said he thinks our son is literally evil. That sometimes he wants to break a broom over his head. I didn't even know what to say. I feel like as an adult, even if our son can be difficult he shouldn't be thinking that way? It's a child, our child??

I know that he loves me. He buys me things often that I don't ask for, and tells me often. He hasn't cheated that I'm aware of. He does have bad mood swings every now and then and yells at pretty much all of us. Not that long ago he walked out the door and said ""fuck you all"" on his way out after I sort of defended our son. But I'm at my wits end. I'm nearly 30 and I feel like I can't continue this cycle into my older years. I'm miserable. Some days I find myself daydreaming about living in my own home without him in it so I dont have to listen to his negativity. Or sometimes just being with someone else. Which both make me feel incredibly guilty because he's all I've known for so long and I don't want to hurt him by not really wanting this anymore.

So, my fiance's sister is getting married this summer, and I will be a part of the wedding party. She has already bought my dress and told me that she is covering for my hair and makeup as well. All good. 

Well I was just informed today that I will be getting a spray tan for the wedding. I wasn't asked if I would like to get one, I was just told that it was going to happen. There will be a test run, and then we will be getting the tans two days before the wedding.

I have never, ever gotten a tan before. I've never gotten a SPRAY tan before. I am as white as a ghost and have always been such. A regular tan isn't an option, because I do NOT tan, I only burn. Even after getting darker after months of being outdoors during the summer back in high school, I was still pale as hell. I think I will look unnatural with any sort of tan. I'm honestly really upset about the situation, and there is no arguing with them. I am meek and quiet and they are loud and commanding. I just smiled and nodded along.

Anyways, in the case of me absolutely hating the tan, I would like to know the fastest way to get rid of it the moment that I am able. Or a way to make whatever they put on me not as dark. Or something. I'm just really scared that I'm either going to feel ugly for weeks and be humiliated or just look incredibly stupid for this wedding that I was actually looking forward to before. I don't want to upset or anger anyone so I'm just trying to do this as pain-free as possible.

If anyone is curious, I was told that I needed a tan because otherwise I would look terrible in the bridesmaid dress that fiance's sister picked out.

My kids have said a lot of disturbing things including that they have a new dad they don't like, and a new sister.

We recently got married in October and before we got married she expressed feelings of individuality. We talked about it and I told her that I could give her the space she needed to work on herself and the marriage had been going well. 

Then about a month ago she tells me again she's had those feelings again. We talked about it and she was like it feels so stupid to talk about it because I am happy. Then two weeks ago she comes home from dinner with coworkers and tells me that she kissed her co-worker. She begged for my forgiveness and said she would do anything to make it better. I told her I believed we could work through it. 

Then 5 days later on her way home from work she calls me and tells me that she's staying over with her sisters and needs space. I begged her to stay and that I would do anything to make it work but she said it was her decision. We decided to talk again 5 days later. Her family loves me and they continually told me what she was saying and she was telling them that she wanted to separate and see other people. 

I accidentally ran into her before we decided to talk where she told me she wanted to separate and date around. I told her I would do anything for her, but then as I left and thought more about it I realized that was very disrespectful to myself and I didn't want my wife to date, anyone. When we finally talked I told her that I thought we should get a divorce because it would only lead to resentment from me if we separated and dated other people and we don't have many joint assets to divvy up. She was shocked by this and I left to stay with my parents and she could stay at the house. 

 I had to come back because I forgot some clothes. We ended up talking more about it and talking about how rough it has been and one thing lead to another and we had sex. After, she asked me to leave the house. 

Today, I told her that was a mistake and that I was upset that she was not going to give our marriage and relationship another try. Everything is pointing to her not wanting to and she made her mind but a part of me wants so bad for her to change her mind. I don't know what to do at this point I feel so sad and worthless. It also happened within the span of two weeks. I have no idea why she is refusing counseling or trying to make it work, I have been nothing but a great partner in my life to her. 

I don't know where to go from here. I know one day she will regret this. I have a great job, I always was kind and listened to her. She was my best friend. I have no idea how to be single now and what to do. I looked into divorce and we can get it done amicably, I believe she said she feels terrible and is confused and doesn't want anything of mine.

"Hey all!
Hopefully this is something I can post here. 

I am not divorced, but my childs (7yo) best friends parents are going through a nasty one. 

My question is how to handle this situation as a friend of the parent going through this and as a parent. 

I am close to the mom, not the dad. And they currently have a ‚Äúnot court ordered‚Äù 50/50 custody agreement. They‚Äôre awaiting their trial. 

My child is constantly asking for play dates, because before the divorce they were a weekly thing. Now though, the dad will not answer my texts or calls when he has the kids. The only time my kids have play dates is when they‚Äôre with their mom. 

Dad keeps them from birthday parties and basically any extra curricular activities that he isn‚Äôt part of. He will make his kids feel guilty for not staying home with him by saying things like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll miss you if you go‚Äù or ‚Äúyou can go play with your friend, OR if you stay home we will go to the circus and shopping and ice skating!‚Äù so they will say no to play dates. (They NEVER did these sort of things before) It feels very manipulative to me.

I‚Äôve just started not asking them to play because I feel guilty taking a day from the mom every week she has her kids, when she only gets them two weeks a month to begin with. 

Has this happened to any of you during your divorce? What did you do? It feels like this is child neglect in the form of denying socialization with their peers. 

Side note: I do understand the importance of family time. But every time I see the other child they beg me to come over and play. So it‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt want to, they do! Dad just won‚Äôt give up any of his time with them. I tell them every time, ‚Äúyou are always welcome! Just tell your dad when you want to come over, and I‚Äôll make it happen!‚Äù

"My fiance and I got engaged about a month ago and are trying to plan a 2022 wedding. I know a little crazy. My best friend (I'm her maid of honor and she's mine) has been engaged since the end of 2019. Her wedding had been delayed by COVID, but also by her not planning it. Her wedding had been scheduled to be in 6 months for almost a year a half now. (She changes when she'll get married as she realizes that the date she wants is impossible given the little she's done to plan)

My fiance and I have been more driven. Last weekend, we viewed 4 venues and 3 churches. We loved a particular venue, it's close to the church we like and our officiant is available that day. I call all my bridesmaids to make sure they're available. Well, my maid of honor (MOH) has finally decided when she wants to get married. It would be the Saturday the week before the Sunday we want (8days apart). She doesn't want our weddings so close. She doesn't want to have to have a short honeymoon or delay it by a week. Our venue has literally no other dates this year. 

My fiance and I agreed to reschedule, but I'm kind of regretting it. My fiance is furious at her. I'm very annoyed. We're stressed because we have limited time and this was a dream venue (heavily discounted because it's so soon). 

Is she right that it would be crazy to have our weddings back to back? Do you think it's worth it to try to convince her?

"This is mainly a post to get this off my chest to people who will (maybe) understand.

I bought a wedding dress off Facebook marketplace last summer, from a girl who'd worn the dress for her own wedding. Initially I was outwardly very happy with it, but I had some doubts that I just assumed were pretty common, or part of my anxiety/OCD. I kept it stored at a family friend's house as we live in a small home and it was hard to fit it in storage here.

I picked up the dress last night and tried it on again. I just don't want to wear it. This doesn't feel like dress regret, this is like a deep ""I WILL NOT wear this"". It's pretty obvious that it's a very cheaply made dress. The material, especially the lace and tulle, is cheap, scratchy and stiff and the skirt doesn't sit well at all. The underlay of the skirt is hideous and shows when I move. It has off the shoulder sleeves and I can't lift my arms. The thought of having our first kiss and not being able to comfortably put my arms around my husband makes me want to cry. I noticed these things at the time but I think I was still so excited that I was able to put them aside.

So yeah, wish me luck I guess. I've ordered 5 ready-to-wear dresses to try on that arrive tomorrow, and I have a lovely tailor near me who will be able to make small changes to them with a very quick turnaround.

"Hi all, not sure if I'm just being super anxious about this because of past experiences or what. Both my fiance and I have been royally screwed with in our journey to find our wedding outfits, so I'm feeling extra vigilant. I'd appreciate any opinions. 

The place where I bought my dress recommended a tailor. This tailor has won awards and is highly rated. The dress shop owner told me to be persistent with emailing them, as the tailor isn't by their computer all day. Totally understandable, they're working on dresses day in day out. 

So I emailed, and to be expected I waited about a week with no response and emailed again to follow up. They got back to me and commented that I was very persistent, then asked a question I had already answered in a previous email. No big, I guess they didn't see the first email on the chain.

They suggest a date that I couldn't make in April, so I emailed back with my commitments so far in April and May in case they were booked out that far. I also asked if they could suggest a few dates in their calendar just in case something else comes up. Then I wait another week. I email back to check in, and added a few more days that won't work for me as I had just scheduled things. 

They ask ""OK what about X day at Y time?"", I say sure, and because I hadn't clarified before I ask what month, April or May? They say ""Ummmm April. Am I missing something? Honestly."" 

Like... I already hate being an inconvenience/burden to someone. And maybe their hand just slipped, maybe the ""honestly"" was autocorrected. Plus this is all over email, and interpreting tone through text is tricky.

However this is my dress we are talking about, custom made. I don't want them to screw something up by being forgetful. God forbid I pissed them off somehow and they do something malicious. I have already gone through hell with a different dress and don't want this to be a reoccurring theme.

"I (35f) finally got to a place where I felt strong enough to ask my wife (39f) for a separation and had a day planned in my mind when the kids would be at school/ daycare and she wouldn't be working. Spoke to my therapist and had thought out what I actually wanted to say in the conversation and felt like I was gathering my nerve.  

Then our 7 yo tested positive so we are in home isolation for 7 days in our town house with her and our 2 yo. My wife is an essential worker and her work has got an exemption for her to work as long as she has negative RAT results and no symptoms and is pressuring her to go in from tomorrow.  

I work in a corporate role from home so it's assumed I will take time off work even though I am the main breadwinner.

"Anyone remember those extreme couponing shows, i feel like I could make that but for weddings. Lol
I'm doing a sept wedding. There a few themes that I have just stuck to and I'm trying to find a way to make it work.  My grandmother who raised me, passed last year. I had a dream of putting together my bouquet with her fake flowers she would change through the seasons and,  in a very cinematic way for a dream,  wrapping them in a ribbon she had.  I felt it was her way of giving me the blessing and being part of it.  I didn't know this ribbon existed but as soon as I asked my uncles who are still cleaning her stuff and described it to them they told me they knew exactly which one I was talking about.  It was like a shimmery burnt orange ribbon. And sunflowers. I just took to it,  they're part of the flower.  I only have 1 maid of honor and my girls will be ring bearer/flower girl. My issue is I don't know what color to make the girls dresses because I want fall theme but I'm scared the red/burgundy my MOH suggested might make it look dark or Christmasy.

We‚Äôre now four months out from the wedding and Hanna has been extremely overbearing and self-centered - asking to wear a dress that not only would not match the other bridesmaids, but which would compete with my bridal gown, saying it would mean soo much to her if she could wear this, asking if I could change the date and location of the bachelorette for her alone, telling me she would struggle to fit the BM dress of my specifications (one specification: it should be blue) in her suitcase (what color dress would not be a struggle to put in your suitcase then??).

Now is your chance to discover who YOU are and focus on yourself! I got into a relationship around 4 months post divorce with my highschool sweetheart and she has been nothing but supportive and help with everything.

Life does not stop at divorce, look at it as a fresh beginning, take advantage of it.

There is one more important thing, look back at yourself and think really hard, ‚Äúare there things I done wrong?‚Äù If there are some things then work on that. None of us is a perfect person and we all have our shortcomings but never believe divorce was ENTIRELY your fault.

"My ex and I divorced in October of 2020.  She relocated, with our elementary age kids, from Mississippi to Florida(10hr drive) in July of 2020.  I fought the relocation, but she won.  She had already established primary custody of the kids, leaving me with visitation every other weekend, via a temporary court order.  The relocation changed the final visitation to me getting the kids every other thanksgiving, Christmas, and Spring Break, as well as every summer break.  

This schedule is extremely difficult, and I have been considering moving.  After a quick search, it appears that FL‚Äôs default is to award parents joint custody, as well as a 50 mile relocation clause.

If I were to move, could I have my custody agreement modified to gain joint custody and enact the 50 mile relocation clause?  I‚Äôm fearful of moving, and her relocating again out of spite.  

Joint custody would also change my child support obligation.  Basically, if each parent makes the same income and has joint custody, no child support is awarded.  Say if she made 50k, and I made 60k, the obligation would be greatly reduced.

I finally asked him what was going on between us and he didn‚Äôt have an answer, but when I asked him when his last relationship was, he said 2 years ago. He didn‚Äôt stop there though, he dropped the bomb on me that he‚Äôs married.

I don‚Äôt know how divorce works in the military, let alone how the military handles spousal abandonment.

"My wife, without consulting me, filed for divorce in October, a week before or 21st anniversary. We'd been going through problems for several years, but we had been working on it, up through August, when she walked out of therapy because she felt our marriage therapist was taking my side (he wasn't; he was her hand-picked therapist when she felt the previous one was taking my side).

At any rate, she immediately stopped wearing her ring. She'd actually been 'forgetting' to put it on for a few weeks before she filed. She'd leave it on the counter, and if I mentioned it to her, she'd say she forgot, then continue to leave it there for 2-3 days. 

I continued wearing my ring. Not that I thought we were getting back together; there was too much hurt. But I thought I could at least end the marriage in the same way I started, respectfully. 

I didn't even want to wear a ring, initially. My father never did, and he was devoted to my mom completely. He just wasn't one for jewelry. But when I mentioned that, my wife (fiance at the time) had a meltdown the likes of which I'd never seen. So I wore a ring.

Last week, she went to Florida for Spring Break. Left her ring behind. I'd look at it on the counter, and my own ring on my hand, and wonder why I was even trying. The respect she felt a ring embodied, she wasn't willing to give that to me. So, the night before she came back, I took off my ring. Put it on the ring holder she keeps hers on.

It's been five days. This is the longest I haven't had it on in 2 decades. Several years ago, I had it resized because I had gained some weight. It felt so unusual at the time, two days without it. 

But in the last two years, I've actually lost 70 lbs., and the ring was slipping off my finger. I improved myself, in that and many other ways, and the improved version of me is one my wife doesn't want to be married to. Literally and metaphorically, my ring no longer fits me.

She hasn't said anything yet. I don't know if she's noticed, and I'm not trying to pick a fight by calling attention to it. It's just... it's a physical reminder of our relationship that I've clung to for months after she disposed of hers. And I've finally taken that step.

"I‚Äôve been with my husband since 2015. Married since 2017. He‚Äôs divorced and has a daughter. She‚Äôs like my little girl as well. We have twin boys together. They are two. We are doing a military move to Alaska end of this year. I‚Äôm currently hiding at work and crying. 

Things were great when we got together. Then we went through money issues. Were terribly poor. Then I lost my sex drive. Then we had the boys. Then he became a drill sergeant (so he‚Äôs never home). It‚Äôs just been one thing after another. And I keep telling myself it‚Äôs because of all those things that I‚Äôm unhappy. But I‚Äôm really considering things deeply. Before we make this drive to freaking Alaska in fall‚Ä¶

I wrote a list of the good and the bad. The pros and the cons. The what ifs. 

If I do divorce, I have no friends that can help, no family at all. No home. I‚Äôll just stay in the state I‚Äôm in. Which is fine with me. I truly love it here. But how will I provide for the kids? How will I continue to pay my truck which is half my paycheck and pay for rent and pay for food and utilities? How will I survive? How will I pay for a babysitter?

We, together as a couple, have a great income. I am grateful we are financially content now. But on my own, with twin toddlers, that‚Äôll be different. Hard. Scary. I know it will. 

But through the seven years I‚Äôve been with him, I‚Äôve lost my sex drive. Completely. We are poly and I don‚Äôt find attraction to anyone else. I‚Äôve tried. I am no where near the person I used to be. And now I don‚Äôt have a choice cause my main responsibility is raising kids. 

He‚Äôs not ‚Ä¶a bad guy‚Ä¶ I keep telling myself, we‚Äôre okay financially now. The darkness is almost over. Once we go to Alaska and he‚Äôs not a drill sergeant anymore everything will be fine. Or maybe I should wait and see if it is in fact fine again. ‚Ä¶. Right? Give it another chance‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs what I keep doing. I keep giving it another chance. But simultaneously, the shit that has come through our lives has caused it as well. 

We had this talk‚Ä¶ thousands of times before. He loves me. He‚Äôll never find someone like me. If we end it, he won‚Äôt be able to find anyone else. He‚Äôs never cheated on me. But he doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶. He‚Äôs not there. He doesn‚Äôt love me the way I asked. He‚Äôs never comforted me when I cried without me telling him what to do. He doesn‚Äôt go out of the way to buy me things. He never compliments me unless I lead him to it. He‚Äôs never done anything cute for me‚Ä¶ there are three dried flowers hanging in my office. The only three bouquets he‚Äôs ever given me. And sometimes I look at them and I feel guilty. Maybe I‚Äôm asking for too much. Maybe I‚Äôm ungrateful. 

I lost my best friend after my boys were born because she told me that I had everything she wanted but I was still unhappy. That I still complained about my relationship and motherhood and life. That I should be happy because I have my own house my own car and a husband. 

Hell, I‚Äôm even looking at my list I mentioned earlier and thinking maybe this is what life is. You loose yourself you loose the desire for affection and sex and you raise a kid and you work and just. Exsist. 

I was a psych student. Therapy doesn‚Äôt help me. Meds don‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm not dangerously depressed. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. 

Where will my boys and I go if I divorce him. Where will I find the money survive us three? What will happen to my husband? Why am I so scared of leaving him because I don‚Äôt want to hurt him? I don‚Äôt want him to be hurt. I don‚Äôt want him to go through that. But the past seven years I‚Äôve been doing so much for our relationship. Fuck man I‚Äôve even bought a notebook and wrote on the front BOOK OF LOVE and created a diary on how to do things for me to show love‚Ä¶. And the only time he used it was for Christmas last year. 

I‚Äôve showed him and told him for years what I need and what he doesn‚Äôt do and it just doesn‚Äôt came. There‚Äôs always work or the kids or something. 

I guess this I s a vent but also I‚Äôm just scared. I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôm almost 27. He‚Äôs almost 32. Our kids will be 3 this year. He doesn‚Äôt have full custody of his daughter. She starts with her mom. But we are all cordial abs here and I get along great. I even found out they divorced borderline the same reasons expect he cheated and was a more angry person. He‚Äôs never been violent with me. Abs though I‚Äôve tried to find a reason, I want to believe he‚Äôs never cheated on me. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. My heart is telling me just wait for Alaska. It‚Äôll be normal again once he has regular work hours again.

"When I asked each of my 3 ladies to be a bridesmaid, I let them know that 1) I would be paying for the dress and 2) my priority is for them to feel happy and beautiful standing next to me. I asked them to please send me styles they would like in our group chat and I'll pick some things for them I like too. Each has a different body type but since there's only 3 of them, I said I'd like for them to wear the same dress if possible. It's a 3 yes, 1 no situation. If we can't find a single dress that makes all of them feel beautiful while in it, they'll wear different dresses in the same color made from the same material.

They've each shown me different dresses and given me their opinions on the ones shared with them. The issue I'm having is that one BM is sharing dresses with a specific feature that I really do not like, but she really does. I won't say what the feature is because I don't want to offend anyone who is a fan, but I personally find it to be more trendy than timeless. It's really not something that I want in my forever photos. One BM knows I am not a fan of this trend but she can go either way, and the third is very go with the flow about it.

This weekend I'm going with two of them to a bridal store so they can try on different styles and see how they look on their bodies because we'll most likely be ordering online. Is there a polite way for me to veto all dresses with that particular feature before they pick anything out? Should I wait to see what that BM picks and make a comment about how much more fabulous she would look if the dress didn't have that feature if she picks out something that does? Or should I be keeping my mouth shut and just getting them what they want since they're going to be the ones wearing the dresses?

"So - I've (42F) been divorced from my ex (43M) about 7 years now. He gets super ragey with the kids sometimes and I don't know what do do, or if I can do anything, because he's not physically hurting them. I'd love to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation and if there's anything that can be done from a legal standpoint?

I initiated the divorce, and part of it was because of his ragey behavior. We were married ten years and he never got physically violent, but he has always been easily set off by things if his life wasn't going super smooth. He broke a window once out of anger because our daughter (3 at the time) spilled a bowl of cereal on the floor.

We did the divorce ourselves, it was amicable, fair, and we generally coparent really well. I have primary custody, he has every other weekend and basically whenever he wants them, so it works out to be 2-3 weekends a month plus a couple week-long stretches during school breaks. After the divorce he became a much better and more involved father than he ever was (he was not very involved before except when it was convenient for him) which is a good thing but he still continued to get very angry. 

He has narc tendencies so a lot of this is that he has a hard time parenting because he views his kids as an extension of himself, not as their own people. Most of the rage stuff would surprise the hell out of most people who know him. People who aren't on the ""inside"" see a super smart, handsome, nice, kind, mellow man. He actually successfully hid his rages from me until about 6 months after we were married. Since the divorce he has always projected that ""laid back guy"" persona when I'm around but as soon as I leave, he turns into angry guy again and yells at the kids for all sorts of little things.

Years ago, our oldest (now 15) wrote him a letter about how his behavior really hurts her. She's an empath, deals with anxiety and he's a really large dude and when he gets ragey it can be scary and feels like an emotional assault for her, even if it's not directed at her. He told her he'd try to do better, and she's periodically told him again (I think she said twice since then) but she's really frustrated because she rightfully feels it isn't her job to try and get him to control himself.

He's going through a lot of stress right now, and last weekend they were at his house and he really, REALLY blew up, destroyed things, etc. I had two of my three kids texting me that they didn't feel comfortable, that they wished they weren't there, ""I don't know how much more of this I can take"" etc.

So - the thing is, our entire divorce was done without attorneys and any kind of major conflict. But this needs to stop and I'm not sure what kind of legal recourse I have because it's not like he's physically abusing them but it's emotional abuse hands down. I let it go previously because I didn't think anything could be done AND I thought it was getting better, but kids say it's not getting better.

I don't WANT to bring anything legal if I can, but the fact is it's been 7 years and the KIDS have even asked him (I asked him so much he started being dismissive of me) to stop. 

For now, I'm documenting everything, gonna have the kids write down what happens in their words when it does, and I'm writing him a firm but not bitchy email so it's on paper basically telling him I understand he's having a hard time but this is getting out of hand and he needs to stop. And - I figure - if he DOESN'T stop I may have to play hardball, but I'd like to cover myself and make sure if he chooses to go that route that I'd be most likely to win in court and it wouldn't be a waste of time.

Now - after all that - has anyone been in a similar situation and has any thoughts to share on what can be done legally?

"I could really use some help.

I'll preface this by saying I'm autistic, so I don't always understand social conventions or the impact that they can have on people.

So I wanted to ask, how to you find the right balance between:

 'it's your wedding so you should do what makes you happy. '

And

'the wedding is important for your family so you have to do what makes them happy so you don't hurt them.'


I just don't understand what the rules are. I'm having people tell me in the same breath that I should do whatever I want, but not that, because it will hurt people's feelings.


What parts am I allowed to say, no this is our wedding and this is what we want. And which parts do I have to say, OK its not what we want, but we'll do it anyway. 


Am I allowed to pick my own bridesmaids? Or is that too offensive to the people who don't get picked? Because it's turning into a huge issue and I feel exhausted and confused. Why is it selfish to want my best friend to be with me? Do we get to make a guest list, or do my parents get to decide that for us? Or is it like a percentage thing? We invite 50% of the people we want and they get the other 50%?

How many 'traditions' do I need to include? Do I have to do a first dance, cake cutting, bouquet toss? Or is it like, I need to let my mum pick one and his mum pick the other? Is there a quota of things we don't want that need to be included to make other people happy?


It has never once occurred to me to be offended by someone else's wedding plan. And I don't understand why our wedding is so important to other people. Of course I don't want to hurt anyone, but why is not hurting them more important than not hurting us?

So not engaged yet, but it‚Äôll be happening soon-ish I‚Äôm sure. My boyfriend and I are very set on getting married within the next 2 years. 

I‚Äôm Nigerian, born and raised in America. I can‚Äôt speak my parents‚Äô language because they never taught us, I‚Äôve barely worn any of the traditional clothing since I was maybe 7/8 years old, we don‚Äôt attend any Nigerian churches, I wasn‚Äôt raised in a Nigerian area, and my mom has alienated us from a lot of our family due to unrelated issues. We eat the food semi often, and play the music but that‚Äôs it. Needless to say, I wasn‚Äôt raised very Nigerian at all. My boyfriend is white, also American

We met, work and live in western PA. He grew up around here, and I grew up in NJ. My mom is still there, and some other family/family friends and my high school friends. but much of my family is sprinkled all over the country. I have college friends, and coworker friends here in PA. So naturally, we just kind of planned on having some sort of wedding+reception near where we live. But all of a sudden, my mom is almost‚Ä¶ pretending? she raised us traditional Nigerian, and keeps saying she ‚Äúexpects‚Äù my boyfriend and I to have a second traditional ceremony, or at least a celebration in NJ, where we would both be dressed in Nigerian garb, and do lots of tradition such as prayers. She said if I get married in PA, she couldn‚Äôt guarantee that many people from our side would come, since I live several hours away. She wants the chance for more of my family/family friends to be apart of it. While I want the same, I am annoyed that just because people may or may be able/willing to travel the 5.5-6 hours, that means *i* have to come to them?

I kind of just want a traditional medium sized/slightly small American wedding and reception here in PA, and then I want to go on a honeymoon and move on. I know you‚Äôre all going to say that I should do what I want, but Im semi close to my mom and now I feel like..

1. Stop sleeping in the same bed as a man who never gave you his whole heart. Drag the mattress out of the bedroom into the living room and make it your home until you can afford to walk out the apartment door and never return. Cry and shake and beat the bed for all the years you spent believing his apathy was indicative of your worth. Swear to yourself that you will never again lay with someone who does not want to lay with you.
2. Spend an afternoon scrolling through each and every photo the two of you took together. Or, I should say, that you took of him. Wonder for a moment about how many photos the man has of you on his phone. Imagine that number is next to zero and let that sit in your heart. When you feel the anger start to rise in you, delete every photo of him. No, don‚Äôt archive. Delete. Empty the trash. Leave no trace of his face in your life.
3. On the days when you are sad, lonely, exhausted, and feeling utterly hopeless about any possibility of a beautiful future because you find that the life you imagined for yourself is crumbling away before your very eyes, give yourself space to feel it all. There is nothing to be gained by running from your emotions. Pain will follow you wherever you go, and suffering comes from refusing to let yourself feel what you need to feel. Your emotions, though overwhelming, will pass. They shift and change like the rising tides, waves swelling and subsiding with rhythmic certainty. So learn to move with the waves, and maybe soon you‚Äôll begin to ride them.
4. Rediscover your love for words, their power and influence in the aftermath of him. You don‚Äôt know it just yet, but looking back will reveal how much his presence silenced you. Ache for the things you did not say. Weep for the journals that could have been filled had your voice not been torn away. Read your own words, reflect on their power. Notice how seasons of hatred towards yourself tore you down further. Notice how kind and compassionate words act as antidotes to the animosity. You, my dearest, are a writer. But you let his words matter more than yours. You let his words matter more than his action. Be careful to never succumb to the seduction of sweet words without action again.
5. Eventually, you will find yourself in the bed of a stranger. The first time will bring you to tears, overwhelmed with emotions swirling inside of you, sensations of longing and passion for the man before you moving alongside grief and regret for the ways your husband debased you. Of the many beds in which you will lay, few will feel as significant as this. Remember every detail, from the taste of his salty skin to the way the autumn light dappled the parquet floors. Even your body will carry this moment with you for years, scars on your toes where his carnal passion collided with a rug too rough for skin as fragile as yours. With time, learn to leave behind the lie that your body was ever the problem. With time, believe you deserve to be loved for your whole being.

"I am asking this for a friend of mine. I‚Äôll call him John (36m). 

John has been in a relationship with his now wife for nearly 10 years. They met when they were young and partying and she ( Sarah 35f ) accidentally got pregnant. John did his best to pull his life together and do what he thought was best by staying with Sarah and eventually getting married when their son was a few years old. 

Their son is now 8 and it has been revealed that John had been having an affair with someone he fell deeply in love with. He ended up breaking it off because of the guilt and shame but mostly the fear of losing his son. John has always felt strongly that he would sacrifice his happiness in order to stay as a family unit with his son. 

He ended up confessing things to Sarah out of fear she would find out herself. She hasn‚Äôt forgiven him but she has agreed to stay in the house with him as long as he never talks to the other girl again and proves himself trustworthy. 

The whole situation makes me so sad. Sarah has never been romantic or affectionate outside of having sex while drunk. They have not been intimate in nearly 5 years and during that time John has suffered from many mental health issues causing him to take time away from work. During that time his son was diagnosed as mild autistic which has added another layer to his guilt.  John has said many times that he loves Sarah because they share a son together but they are roommates going through life together. 

My question is this ‚Ä¶. What are the pros and cons to staying together mainly because you have a child ? I recently asked my therapist her opinion and she said that studies have continued to show that when parents get divorced and co-parent , the child turns out better adjusted then staying in a house with two parents that don‚Äôt love each other anymore.

"Hello everyone,

Tl;dr: My story and asking how to cope with the grief

I'm so glad to have found this sub. I need to tell my story to someone and I'll appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it. Also, please excuse potential language mistakes, I'm not a native speaker.

So, yeah, 16 days ago, my wife told me that she will leave me. I was completely dumbfounded at first and could barely believe my ears. For me, her decision came completely out of the blue. My wife (F32) and I (M33) have been together for 11 years and married for 4.5 years. We've had to go through a ton of rough times together but none of those were ever related to our relationship. Our relationship was like a large rock in a stormy ocean. At least that's how it felt for me. She and I were always like peas and carrots, arguments barely occurred and if they did, we were usually able to resolve them the same day. Everything was extremely harmonious. Although I had never thought such a thing existed, my wife is truly the love of my life; my soulmate. It may sound corny but I would've betted all of my earthly possessions that we'll grow old together and one day be a cute, elderly couple, like my grandparents.

My wife's main reason for leaving me is rather unique. It has nothing to do with cheating or addiction or even major incompatabilities. Rather, it has to do with the way I was born. Without making this too complicated, I was born with a rare genetic disorder that is incurable and leads to complete blindness on both eyes. When my wife and I met in our early 20s, my vision was already quite bad but it was still leaps better than it is now. I was able to get around independently, I was able to ride my bicycle, I was able to read physical books and write by hand... just to give you an idea. Strangers sometimes didn't even notice I was visually impaired because I knew how to hide it. This all changed 5 years ago. Around the time of our wedding, my eyesight suddenly began to decrease dramatically. As a result, one of the toughest periods of my life began (before my wife's revelation to leave me, I'd have said ""THE toughest time of my life""). Within a few years, I've lost virtually all of my remaining vision, including all of my functional vision. All I'm left with is perception of light/darkness. Of course my doctors tried to halt or at least slow down the process. I underwent countless surgeries, some of which caused me immense physical pain and took months to heal. I fell into a deep depression, began to go to therapy and slowly worked on climbing out of that hole again.

Of course this time wasn't just difficult for me, it was also difficult for my wife. She often had to take up most or all of the work because I was simply not able to (emotionally and physically). Whenever I was released from hospitals, she had to nurse me until I was feeling better again (cook meals, help me take my meds etc.). Of course I always felt really bad about that but I couldn't see any other way to do it. I tried to express my appreciation to my wife by showering her with physical affection as well as compliments, statements of gratitude etc. I know it's not much but I tried to make this effort. Despite my depression and physical pain, I always made sure to treat her with all the love in the world.

Unfortunately, I now know it wasn't enough for her. My wife told me that she had been feeling overburdened for years and that she was ""sick of it all"", including me. What makes her decision particularly tragic is the fact that half a year ago, my health finally improved and stabilized. I'm now blind but at least I won't have to do surgeries in the near future anymore. I also don't have to take a lot of meds anymore or constantly visit the doctor.

Like I mentioned, her decision has come completely unexpected for me. Although my wife claims to have told me about her exhaustion throughout the years, I can't remember her doing so. I love her to bits, so I just can't imagine myself ignoring such pleas... at least not intentionally! What I do remember is her giving me a lot of mixed signals. For example sometimes I felt like she looked very exhausted and depressed but when I asked her, she'd tell me: ""don't worry, everything's fine, you have it much worse.""

What hurts and frustrates me more than anything, however, is my wife's total refusal to give our relationship another chance. During the past 2 weeks, I have pleaded with her in desperation, I have begged her, thought of a million solutions and made countless offers to her. I've asked her to go to couple's therapy with me, I've offered a time-out (her moving out for a few months), I've given her all the concessions you can possibly think of. Just to give one example, my wife and I used to be in a half-open relationship where she'd have sex with other men but I didn't. This worked fine for us and it was never a matter of conflict until, one day, she demanded the freedom to not just sleep with other people but also fall in love with them. At the time, I told her I felt very uncomfortable about this idea because I was scared she'd leave me for another guy. Now, during the past 2 weeks, I've even made this concession to her: I told her that she'd have the freedom to sleep AND fall in love with other men if only she'd give our relationship another chance. But my wife has turned into solid rock. She says no to everything, rejects every offer/idea, refuses to give me/us even the slightest chance. She told me she'll move out soon and that's the end of it.

I'm heartbroken beyond description. I know it doesn't feel this way to my wife but to me, it feels as though I'm being punished for my disability. I've apologized to my wife a thousand times for the burdens I gave her but what should I say... it wasn't my choice to be born like this. Going blind in your late 20s/early 30s is shitty enough, being left/divorced for losing your eyesight... that's too much pain to bear.

I also think my wife did this in a rather heartless and selfish way because of how our two lives have developed over the years. My wife comes from a country in East Asia. She moved to my country to be with me. I helped her in every way I could; I taught her the language, helped her with all the legal immigration stuff, and also supported her financially. Naturally, I did all of this gladly because I love her so much. My parents also supported her financially, even long before we were married. Meanwhile, her parents didn't even attend the wedding because they were pissed she had decided to marry a disabled guy (i.e. useless human waste in their opinion). My wife got her Master's and managed to be accepted as a PhD student. Again, I supported her with that, too. She now has a permanent residence permit, a decently paying job and a golden academic career in front of her. Meanwhile, I have nothing. I was never able to finish grad school because of my disability and the health problems. I don't have any type of income. I was finishing my Master's thesis this year (till summer) and getting my degree but now that I'm dealing with all this pain, I'm not able to work anymore (so I won't make it).

Also, I've been wanting to have a child with my wife since our mid-20s. I kept bugging her about it, even thought of cute names etc. She always claimed to want kids but ""a bit later"". She'd repeat this same phrase every year. Now, after ""dumping"" me like a bag of trash, she told me: ""By the way, I've NEVER wanted to have a child with you because I never thought you'd be capable of taking care of a child considering you're blind. I would've had to do everything by myself."" Now she'll probably date another guy, sleep with him and eventually get pregnant. Maybe she'll even be the one begging for a child. The thought makes me want to die.

Honestly, I don't know how I deserve all this pain. I've spent years climbing out of a deep, dark abyss and just when I reached the edge, my wife kicked me down again. Last week I tried to kill myself but failed. I'm not happy about it. I don't feel some kind of gratitude or new sense of purpose. Only more grief and sorrow. I'm now living with my dad for a while... he insists on watching me, so I don't make further suicide attempts. I can't blame him because they're definitely on my mind.

Anyway, I'm sorry for this extremely long post. But here's my question: how did/do you get through this ocean of pain? Are there things you do that help alleviate the agony a little? I mostly just cry and sleep a lot. But I try to talk to people. Sometimes when my dad isn't home, I recite poems out loud, as though I was speaking to a big crowd. Sometimes I sing sad songs. I feel like that helps a tiny bit.

"The title kind of says it all. It is been a week since my wife asked for a divorce, and I'm getting confused by the range and sudden change of emotions I've been feeling. The first few days is was nothing but pain. I felt lost and didn't know what to do other than cry. Then there was a day of anger. Not directed at her, but for the situation. Anger at myself for not being a better husband. Anger at losing the love of my life. Anger at the living situation we are discussing (we rent and our lease is expiring in two months, she wants to move to a new place with the kids and has as me to move in with my parents until I can find/afford my own place). Anger at knowing I won't see my kids every single day (we already have an agreement that they will be with me a minimum of 3-5 days a week, and will be able to stay with me whenever they want). Also, anger to be starting over at 40 years old. 

Then came a couple days of acceptance and peace. Having realized, while we are still extremely close and still love one another, we have not been happy or in love with each other for a long time, and maybe this was what was best for everyone. 

But the last two days have been very confusing as they have run the gamut of emotions. Going from sad to pain to calm to anger at the flip of a switch.

My question is, has anyone else experienced this? Is it part of the normal grieving process at the loss of a long marriage?

"I feel like I have been getting started with the divorce process for months.  I am sure that many of you feel the same way.  My STBXH has been a stay at home dad, for the past 5 years.  Two years ago I started to talk to him about going back to work.  We have one child that is now 11.  He took the role of stay at home parent literally, and never took our child anywhere.  Covid aside, I am talking to the park, the nature trails, for a walk, the swimming pool, or anywhere.  My kid asked about doing an after school activity when we move, but was afraid that ""dad wouldn't take me.""  I asked why, and kid said, ""he will probably be sleeping."" 

Since the end of November, STBXH has known I wanted a divorce.  He waited until the end of January to begin applying for jobs, and today, an offer came in, and he accepted it.  I have not filed for divorce yet because I did not want him to be without health insurance, but that all changes when he starts his new job.  His insurance will take effect immediately, and I can now file for divorce.  

The house is set to go up for sale the day after he starts his job, and I am one step closer to being free.    I am also one step closer to happiness.  Going through this process, and living in the same home as my STBXH has been incredibly difficult.  I have never felt time move so slowly in my life.

"26M here in Tx. Post history has background if needed, nothing special tho.  


STBXW and I decided to get divorce not too long ago, when discussing custody we initially talked about split weeks or 50/50, but after thinking about my own experiences of going back and forth and stresses of not having a stable environment, I changed my mind. Imo I have the ability to provide a better environment for my child.  


My hours are consistent in a decent paying job, with a little bit of travel that isn't crazy(I will go to nearby towns but never more than 45 min out of the way, Idk how to word it). She has her own business that has periods of no customers and does side hustles like Uber to try to compensate, which if anyone knows anything about these jobs, you can't really take your kid along and best hours are after school to midnight. As I type this, my daughter is lying down, my exMIlL is passed out and teenager is doing teenage things while STBXW is Ubering, and it is like this multiple times during the week so I am worried what will happen when I am no longer under the same roof.   


Her living is a 2bed small apartment with 4 people in it, and tbh no really responsible adults. My exMIL is mostly incapacitated at night due to mental health meds, and that's IF she's taking them due to lapsing on treatment multiple times. Other person is a teenager who can't handle anything, plus being a teenager shouldn't really be relied upon IMO. I will be moving into a 2 bed apartment by myself, in a quiet neighborhood with schools nearby.   


But I know she'll disagree, because of my anger. I have problems with anger and sometimes get besides myself, I've said things and done things that I think about at night. I've gone to counseling multiple times, I've had reassurance from counselors that I am not the same person as before, and as much as I would like to believe that, it gives me an ounce of security. But still, that is my greatest fault, and I know that is the one thing she will hold over my head forever when I bring up custody.   


My job provides benefits, flexibility, and if needed I can stop the traveling and settle in one set location. My STBXW unfortanetly does not have these benefits, and I tried convincing her long before The Talk happened that she should consider her lifestyle. I am aware I need to continue counseling, not just anger but other factors that are no longer issues but will give me greater comfort.  


Please, if anyone can set me straight, tell me I'm shit out of luck, or give advice on what I can do to further help me secure a better environment for my daughter, I will be grateful. Also, I am not wanting to take away complete custody, or have monitored visits or anything extreme, I would just feel more comfortable if my child were with me majority of time, giving them their own space to relax and be a kid.",Custody Advice (26M) (TX),Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"God, this whole thing spun out of control so quickly. My STBX (28m) and I (29f) have known each other since we were teenagers. Our parents are friends, but we only saw each other in person once as his family is from a different country. I had the bright idea to go to see them in person after finishing grad school, back in 2018. We discovered a spark that I wanted to ignore, because I didn‚Äôt want an LDR. He romanced me for the time I was in his country, however, and I couldn‚Äôt find it in myself to say no. And now, here we are, 4 years later, just waiting for the divorce decree in the mail. I don‚Äôt know what went wrong, really. I mean, he started drinking and totaled a car and a fence while drunk driving in October, and then began telling me he thought I was lying to him about what I was spending money on and who I was spending time with, nitpicking my every behavior, believing the worst in me. It was like over the course of a few months everything just devolved and he became a person I didn‚Äôt recognize. I begged him to go to therapy for the drinking and he refused. The final straw, and why I filed for divorce, was that he told me he‚Äôd never go to therapy because it was just a ‚Äúmanipulation effort‚Äù on my part to make him think everything was his fault, even though I explicitly said I didn‚Äôt believe that at all. I filed for divorce the next day. He‚Äôs not fighting me on anything. We don‚Äôt have kids or own property together, so it was a relatively easy process. But I miss him. I miss him being in bed next to me and how he‚Äôd curl into me in the middle of the night. I miss his goofy laughter and the way he looked so proud when he‚Äôd crack a joke. I miss the way he‚Äôd hold my hand and kiss it while we‚Äôd walk together. I shared all the parts of myself I have, including the ones I don‚Äôt like to acknowledge as being me, and he told me he loved me anyway. We had so many plans about how we were going to travel and buy a house to raise our kids in. But that man doesn‚Äôt exist anymore, or, if he does, it‚Äôs so far buried under the alcohol and resentment that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever see him again. I tried to make it work the best I could but I couldn‚Äôt be the only person trying in the relationship. And now all I‚Äôm left with is just this incredible amount of grief.

"Despite my post about a month ago full of fire, I've been stagnating on actually moving forward. STBX finally admitted yesterday that he slept with those strippers or as he calls them ""dancers"" üôÑ He had given me the passwords to his accounts years ago and I never used it because I never had reason to but when I initially found evidence that he was cheating I accessed his personal bank account and the one he kept for his rental property. On the account for the rental property I saw hotel charges in December. I went back as far as October through the current charges in February and those were the only hotel charges I saw. It was four different days. First he tried to Bill Clinton me and be cagey about what sexual relations meant but I would not relent and he finally admitted that he did have sex with those women. Allegedly he did use condoms but I'm still going to make an appointment with my doctor.
We haven't had sex since I found the make up on his shirt. But you can never be too careful. 

I'm angry, disappointed, and shaken but this shores up my resolve to leave. Before yesterday I was considering staying until my health improves (I'm on a wait list for a health procedure that's a few years long) but now I'd rather just go and struggle on my own. Of course he's ""sorry"", more like sorry he got caught imo, and he keeps taking about wanting me and the kids to reap the benefits of his job, etc. 

Now I'm wondering if it would be more advantageous for me to leave now and reap the benefits of his feeling generous and somewhat guilty or if it would be more beneficial to stay and have someone there to physically help with the kids as my health gets worse. Right now he's primarily responsible for getting the kids up and dressed for school while I make breakfast and lunch, he also takes them to school every day. They're not able to go to school on their own yet and the thought of having to take them everyday after getting myself up and ready sounds exhausting even if it would be just part of the time.

"I (35f) divorced my ex (35m) two years ago. I had saved my money secretly for a year prepping to leave while trying to work on things to no avail. I left for a few reasons: 
1. Alcoholism to the point of forgetting where my kids were
2. Spending my money in shady ways, asking for money to ‚Äúpay off a debt‚Äù that never seemed to get paid off, opening credit cards in my name, etc.
3. Being really preoccupied with games and never wanting quality time with me or our kids
So. I had my reasons for leaving. Now my mother always taught me never to talk bad about your spouse to anybody, because it will bias them against your spouse. So I never told anybody our problems, just quietly stewed and tried to fix our marriage by talking with him. 
Once I left; however, my ex told my kids that day without me, even though I expressed I just needed a separation for a bit to think. My daughter told me he said ‚Äúdaddy had a drinking problem, but he quit and mommy still won‚Äôt take him back‚Äù. Putting all the blame on me. 
Then he told my family before I was ready to, and they are still choosing his happiness over mine.

"Night before Easter, it‚Äôs my first weekend with our son in my new place. I was super excited, got everything ready for him, he‚Äôs been excitedly talking about coming to my new place all week. Friday night goes well, he asks to go home a few times and to see mama. We FaceTime her at bed time (she was out with her new boy toy) and all is well.

All day yesterday he kept saying that he wanted to go home that he wanted to be with his mama. I asked if she could take him for the night, explained that he was crying and really wanted to sleep at home. She ‚Äúhad already made plans‚Äù but assured us that she‚Äôd be over to dye eggs in a few hours and that she‚Äôd stay to put him to bed. 

She did that, she saw how he was upset and wanted to go home. I explained that I didn‚Äôt want this to be a traumatic thing for him and a negative experience. She insisted he stay and explained to him that this is his home too and he needs to stay here until Monday. We put him to bed. She went out again with her guy. 

She came over this morning (overslept because she left her phone at the bar), literally still smelled like sex, did the Easter morning thing, and then promptly left to get back to bed. 

I‚Äôm so disgusted and angered by her selfishness. I can‚Äôt believe how she‚Äôs acting and I feel awful for our kid that that‚Äôs his mom.",Just need to vent‚Ä¶,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"I won‚Äôt go into the details of my relationship but I‚Äôm very much considering divorce. My husband is a checked out father and his excuse is ‚Äòhe works‚Äô (9-5). We have a special needs son (5 years old) who I‚Äôve dedicated my life to helping and I love him dearly. My husband is embarrassed of him and has told him such. He cannot handle his needs and always tells me ‚Äòthis isn‚Äôt the life he would have chosen‚Äô. This crushes me for our son. His inability to be a father to our son has really made me fall so far out of love with him. But I keep trying to hang on to ‚Äògive my son his father‚Äô. He is unkind to me as well and says my son and I are responsible for his poor work performance review. We are of of the house everyday 9-4 and he works from home 830-530. But yet he takes midweek days off to go golfing and takes many solo trips. Most recently to Cancun for a wedding. He goes surfing 4-5 times a week. He says he hates his life and it just keeps getting worse the older he gets? He says he doesn‚Äôt have time to learn how to interact with our son bc he works?

If I leave I won‚Äôt be dating any time soon and will take the time I need to focus on myself and life after divorce. I may never dare again.

"So this is kind of a long story (excuse any typos or issues as posting from my phone) 

One of my old friends (29M) (we have drifted apart slightly due to covid restrictions over the last 2 years and our differing opinions on the pandemic however I still counted him as a good friend) When I asked him for his email address to send the invite across to, he told me not to bother and he didn't want an invite. This took me by surprise as we've not had any issues within our friendship and we've known each other for over 15 years. I pushed him to give me a reason and all his points about why he didn't like me was due to the wedding (the wedding I've not spoken directly to him about so clearly someone is bitching about me behind my back to him) 

Another friend (31F) who lives with the other guy is also being funny with me. I told her that I couldn't afford to have her at the wedding the whole day however she would have an invite to the evening (only family are invited to the wedding breakfast and then all our friends can come in the evening) She is saying that she is completely taken aback by me saying this as a passing comment but understands due to cost? Anyway she's not spoken to me since she said I was causing drama, but has rsvp'd to the wedding that she will attend. I'm extremely confused what's been going on here but don't feel like I even want her at the wedding now? 

Then the final situation is my best friend and bridesmaid is the one who's been telling people they are / aren't invited to my wedding. She's been bitching about situations to people regarding me but only telling half a story and turning people against me. 

I just don't know what to do, I'm stressed planning a wedding under ¬£10k, dealing with family's expectations and now I've got a can of worms problem with my friends. 

I'm crying most days about this and completely besides myself. I no long even want this wedding and just elope in a small ceremony. But I can't do that as we have spent all our money and deposits which we cannot afford to lose.

"My wife has let me know that she‚Äôs not happy in our marriage and has to leave in order to find what makes her happy. She assured me it was nothing that I did or didn‚Äôt do, just feelings faded and she feels as if she made the commitment too early in her life (we were together for many years prior to being married but are still in our mid-twenties). This only came to light once I found out she was emotionally cheating with me online with somebody from out of state that had plans to come and meet up with her, in which he had no idea that I existed. I don‚Äôt know what to believe from her anymore since she betrayed my trust and hasn‚Äôt given me any reason to regain this trust.

However, she quickly found out she cannot financially support herself and refuses to file or move out of our rented house. The only option she has is to move back with her parents, in which she planned on doing at the end of the month. However, she doesn‚Äôt feel as if she can find herself moving out of our city and back with her controlling parents. Now, she has came to me asking if she could stay in the spare bedroom instead and save money while still living here with me while paying rent. She has no intention of making this work and it would strictly be a place to stay so she isn‚Äôt forced to live with her parents until she can afford to move out on her own. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm still deeply in love with her and don‚Äôt want her to struggle but also I cannot be a doormat and provide for her while she moves on until she finds what/who she needs to be happy and be miserably supporting her decision in the background by allowing her to stay.

Should I be the bigger person and file for this and kick her out? It feels so wrong to file for a divorce you don‚Äôt want but also I cannot let her stay here and take advantage of me.

"I cheated. We are currently separated, she and our 1 year old stayed in the house that we jointly acquired after I proposed but before we got married. The house is paid for in the following ways:

One part was paid for by me in cash. 

One part was paid for by her ‚Äúsavings‚Äù in cash.  I put this in quotes because these were illegally acquired at her government job and were only usable when laundered through her dad as a ‚Äúgift‚Äù. 

One part was paid for by her dad‚Äôs own savings. She borrowed him. Down the road she is not really intending to pay back, could be considered early inheritance. 

One part (half the cost of the house) - Mortgage. We only qualified for this joint mortgage because I had a job back then and 2/3 of the obligation was my share. 

I had since left formal employment and my income has been okay but un-uniform in private practice. The only reason I didn‚Äôt actively seek employment was because we had a discussion and agreed I shouldn‚Äôt, and instead stay in private practice which left me with more time for her. 

I don‚Äôt wanna lose everything I paid towards the house. I want to insist that we let the bank put the house back on the market if that‚Äôs the only way out. The market is terrible but I am okay losing a bit if it comes to that.

"Very long, I aplogize. 

I met my wife when I was 15 and she was 16. We will call her (B) We met at a summer camp. We dated long distance for a while. We were able to talk about anything and everything as kids. We eventually broke up though. 


   I didn't have the best upbringing. All I wanted was a family of my own. Thibking that would do me good. Oh how i was wrong. I met some one in high-school. We will call her (A). We had baby when I was 17 years old. Then we got married when I was 18. We didn't work out and a divorce by the time I was 19 years old. I felt horrible I felt like who would want to be a with single dad of 1 child and I'm only 19 years old. I struggled with suicidal thoughts. 

   I finally met someone who I ""thought"" loved me. Let's call her (E). I married at 20years old. She was a narcissist and there was physical abuse from her. I joined the Army. The abuse got worse with her. I was still struggling with suicidal thoughts. She ended up in psychatric inpatient program. I needed someone to talk to so I reached out to (B) just as friend. We talked for hours and hours. It was nice but I was still married. So I told (E) that I talked to (B). She didn't like it which was understandable. So I told (B) that out of respect of my then wife (E). I couldn't talk to her anymore. 

    I was 22 years old. I felt trapped with (E) and trapped in the Army. I felt no way out. So I attempted suicide. I survived, thank God. I woke up in the hospital 6 days after I attempted suicide. With no memory of those lost days. I went to inpatient after that. I decided to divorce (E). So when I got out of inpatient I lied to her and to her I had to stay in the barracks instead of going home to her. The race was on I made a new email. I made a new everything. I paid off credit cards and closed them I did everything I could. To cuts ties with her. I told her I wanted a divorce after that. The next day I get a email from (B). Telling me to leave me out of my shit.  (E) messaged (B) telling her this is all her fault. Which it wasn't. It was (E) fault. I told (B) let me explain everything when I get off work. 

   So after that we have been talking ever since may 2019. (B) and I got married. We had a child together. We took over the camp that went together as kids. It felt so meant to be and like a true love story. That all changed on April 1st 2022. When she said she wants a divorce. There was no abuse or cheating. I just struggled with mental health. As did (B) and she also has fibromyalgia. My mental health treatment has been hard for me. Because I know I need to be on meds but anytime I tried meds it never seemed to work. And I when I attempted suicide it was will 250 something pills. So it's a trigger to take pills. 

   After she told me she wanted a divorce. I felt hurt and betrayed. I am crushed by this. What happened  to ""in sickness and in health?"" I stood by her through all her mental health issues and her angry outbursts towards everyone. I even asked her if we could just separate and work on ourselves. She said no she just wants a divorce. She has done this in the past through out her life. She has just gives up and runs away back to her grandmother's home. She is giving into her own negative mental health coping mechanism. I just feel like I'm losing everything in my life my own space, kids, my wife, my dreams with her, my cats, faith in people, and my trust.

"I'm in a 4 year relationship. 6 months married. We were from the beginning sexual incompatible. I'm kinky with HL he vanilla LL. I wanted to try an open relationship but he was hesitant. So we held off. 3 couples counselors and he never wanted to address sex. Once in 4 years I teased him till he asked for a BJ. Everything I enjoy sexually is too kinky and dirty for him. I seriously worried about past trauma or that he is represented but homosexual. A week before the wedding he was ready to open our relationship. He shamed me when I didn't like a person and called me names. As fare as I knew neither of us had even kissed someone else. A week ago he suggested to close our relationship since I got upset  that he forgot our date and made plans with someone else. I agreed. Something was different and I checked his phone. ( yeah pathetic) well he lied the whole time. Has very kinky online adds to find hook ups. Lied to get out of work early and came home late. Has numbers from women under a fake name in his phone. Talks about unprotected sex. Lies about selfies in hotel rooms. He shows no remorse. I'm disgusted by his lies. 
I decided STI checks during my last doctors appointment since I thought there is no way he would ever cheat.

"Having known one of my best friends for 15 years, been together for eight years, and married the past three years, we have both come to an agreement on getting divorced. She had doubts about us around five years ago. (Why get married then?) We both had the mindset of marriage being the next logical step after being together that long. She had high hopes of me choosing to better myself on my own for the betterment of our future, this sadly did not come true.

We have become two completely different people from when we first started dating. Traits out of a wife that I desire, she doesn‚Äôt exhibit and traits out of a husband that she desires, I don‚Äôt exhibit. I know the simple solution could be to compromise on some things, something we just have tried and it m hasn‚Äôt work. We don‚Äôt hold any resentment towards each other about. I don‚Äôt want to hate her for who she has become and she doesn‚Äôt hate me for who I have become.

Her newfound college friends have more or less been the driving force for her to confront our differences and struggles. At first, I was angry at them for making her bring these thoughts to a head, to the point of me becoming suicidal. Some of my mood swings, depression, and grasping at a failing marriage drive her further apart from me. After coming to terms with it all, I‚Äôve become a better person with a better mindset about us. I haven‚Äôt completely given up on us, I still say ‚ÄúI love you, have a good day, good night, or other daily phrases most couples usually say‚Äù as well as a morning kiss on the forehead maybe once a week (all silly things to keep doing, but meaningful to me still). 

We both talked with a relationship counselor to get a non-biased opinion on our situation, mostly to help piece our emotions together a in such a way so that we wouldn‚Äôt scream hurtful words at each other. They were understanding of us, wasn‚Äôt pushing us to not get a divorce, was encouraging for us to pursue a friendship after this (again, 15 year friendship that we both don‚Äôt want to lose).

I will be moving back in with my parents, will be going back to school for my degree, finally. Am excited to redo my old room and make it into a much better space. She will be staying at our apartment for awhile after, but will ultimately move in with her dad and his wife as she goes to full time student next year.

Anyways, thank you for reading this far. I know Reddit isn‚Äôt the best choice for venting some of this air, but I posted something a month ago and it helped me work some stuff out. We both want the other to succeed in life, whether we are there directly or indirectly. I do have the best hope for us in the future, whether we end up back together or just continue to stay good friends. I believe we both have some qualities to work on and see this separation as a good thing for both of us to grow into better people.",Getting divorced after being married for three years,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"My wife and I have been together for 15  years, and have 2 young kids.  My wife comes from a very wealthy family and grew up very privileged.  Our entire marriage, her parents treated me disrespectfully.  Me wife would always defend her parents and make me apologize to her parents.  One example is we met her parents are a restaurant and were waiting in the bar, her parents we not making any attempt to speak to me so I order my wife and I a drink and paid.  Later that night my FIL got angry with me for not asking him to buy me a drink. I am a 40 year old and make 6 figures, I do not need anyone buying me anything.  My wife was angry with me and made me send me a email the next daily apologizing.  I have over 100 examples of this.  Plus my wife does nothing around the house, I do EVERYTHING, Cook, Clean, Lawn, Laundry, etc.  My wife works as well, makes good money and we split taking care of the kids.  But she does nothing for my birthday, I make a big deal for hers.  Buys me nothing for X-mas, I buy her a ton of gifts.  

Well counseling has shown me her behavior was not right, the counselors (we also each see a personal) say her family has a extreme enmeshment.  My ex-sister in law emailed me recently and told me how the wife's parents broke up her marriage to my brother in law as well. My wife and I separated last Summer and her parents tried their hardest to get her to divorce me.  I also found out that 5 years ago when my 2nd son was born with a heart defect and we were stressed about it, the in-laws hired a lawyer and tried to get my wife to divorce me then as well. 

After 8 months of counseling, I feel like I now want out and my wife wants to make it work.  My wife, for 15 years destroyed my self esteem and self worth.  Never having my back and gaslighting me into the villain with her parents.

"Pretty much every course on personal growth talks about forgiveness as being such a critical part of being able to move forward. It allows you to 'complete your past',  learn something from it, and move on. BUT it is so hard. My partner left after 35 years (28 married). He felt he was emotionally numb for at least 20. We never fought. Had so many, so many loving tender moments, but he kept withdrawing into himself. Never said anything. Till the end when he felt he needed to leave.

It has been a year and a half of living apart now. We still meet over weekends. I have begun to understand a little bit about what happened. And in the moment I can forgive him as he did what he did because this is all he could.

Yet at so  many other times I feel so angry. Angry that things did not work out. Angry that he didn't voice things. (he didn't because he had no idea what was going on with him) . Angry that he didn't do better for us.

I really loved him so much. And we built such a lovely family and home together. 

And while everyone tells me I am doing very well, and have managed the break-up very decently, I do feel anger for all the upheaval in my life, the pain, the starting afresh at this stage of life (50F).

"Since I see a bunch of posts about how people don't RSVP (it's true), I thought I'd post some of my results over time since our deadline was a week ago.

Invited: 140

RSVP'ed yes: 110. Still chasing like 8 people -\_- (4 have real reasons to give us a late RSVP)

Timeline: We sent invitations 3 months in advance (we sent digital STD and invites, so we wanted to make sure folks had an early reminder about our wedding was in case they are bad at reading email). We gave them 8 weeks to RSVP (so deadline was 5 weeks before the wedding), and sent a reminder email 1 week before the deadline. Our final catering counts are due 2 weeks before the wedding

RSVPs over time: 35 people replied yes literally in the first 24 hours, 40 people replied yes in the final week, and the remaining 35 replied in between. 20 (so most) of our declines came in the final few days

Geography: 65 people are flying in from out of town. All of the declines are from non-locals

Other: 55 people are attending the Friday welcome party (it's extremely low-key, pre-dinner)

Lessons learned: Expect that there will be a significant amount of non replies near the deadline, don't be afraid to send a reminder, and (in my opinion) don't count on a B list unless your RSVP deadline is well ahead of your wedding.

"I have been with my fianc√® for 8 years and we have been engaged for about a year and a half.

I spent a lot of time thinking about when we would get engaged and how our wedding would be. A lot of it I honestly compared to how things went when my older sister got engaged; myself, our mum and her other bridemaids went all in for her with planning. My sister, mum and I went dress shopping for her and cried when she found ""the one"". We had a shared Pinterest board. We went the absolute extra mile for her bridal shower and hens making sure they were full of surprises and she had the best time. We did a heap of DIY together, went to wedding expos, our whole lives revolved around her wedding! 

When my fianc√© proposed we had a bit of trouble in our relationship the week after, which definitely made it all feel a bit tainted. Regardless, I know that the proposal is just a day in our hopefully long lives together, that doesn't really impact the future of our relationship. 

6 weeks after we got engaged, my mum got diagnosed with terminal cancer, and for the next 8 months I could not even fathom a wedding, as I was overcome with grief. She passed away only 8 months since the diagnosis. The cancer was in the brain, so I had to watch her cognitive decline, which is the hardest thing I have ever been through, and I am still trying to heal. She has been gone nearly 9 months now.

I am definitely still grieving, but I also want to live my life and I know that's what my mum would have wanted. So we have set a date and I have been planning. 

Sadly, I feel that it has been too much for my sister and I feel like she is trying to avoid the subject of the wedding. I didn't get to cry, and hug, and cheer with her when I found my dress. In fact, she kept cancelling when I was trying to show her ""the one"". I feel like when I try to get her advice or opinion she is extremely neutral and uncaring. I have even asked her if me talking about the wedding is upsetting or annoying and she said it isn't. 

I also cut ties with one of my best friends of 7 years, as she was the opposite of supportive when mum died, and even had the audacity to say how many more people were at her friend's funeral than my mum's. So I guess that is another loss I have had to deal with as I expected she would be a bridesmaid. 

So I guess I am asking for any advice from you all when the wedding planning process does not go how you had imagined it to in your head?

I know the marriage is about him and I, but for me the wedding is about our family and friends too. Should I just remain independent in this and do all the planning and organising with my fianc√©? Do I lean more on his family now than my own?

"She filed for divorce in Sept, we've been living seperately since then, we're going to trial. Two sons, 18/14.

Place she lives in a 3bd, I'm renting a room from a friend (so not really suitable for 2 kids). I work and basically spend all my free time w them. 

She works as a bartender, so 4-12am type schedule. When she does have free time she's off exploring her new single life (tells them if you guys don't want to be around me, why should I be here). She's made no attempt to reach out to them. She refuses to sit down and talk w the 3 of us. The few times she has talked to them she just bashes and blames everything on me. She does the same w my family and her friends. I'm the worst person in the world now. She's told the kids our entire 20 year relationship was a delusion, I'm a narcissist that's emotionally abused her (month before she wanted a divorce I was the greatest man ever), that I've manipulated them and turned them against her. I have my flaws, which throughout the last year I've reflected and worked on....but I've always been a good father and loving husband.   

Quick history: she had an affair w a married man 10 years ago, we eventually reconciled. 4 years ago she had sex with her friend (our son's best friends mom) after a drunken night of partying. They both know about her infidelity. 

About a year ago she blindsided me, I was unemployed via covid. She asked for a divorce. She started making new single friends, going out to the bar a lot. I caught her deleting texts w other men during that time, we were still living together (for 9 months after she wanted a divorce). All the while she was adamant this had nothing to do w another man. 

Fast forward to when things escalated. I caught her having sexual relationships w her boss 2 months after separation (before she wanted a divorce, they'd go on bike rides, go to the bar after work, etc. I never felt threatened, he's an old ugly guy...she said they were just friends). I called her out, she gaslighted and called me crazy. Regretable I told the kids about it out of anger, I got worn out with her lying and trashing me to them constantly. It was like a, ""no, that's not why we're getting divorced...this is why"", and I told them about the guy. 

They confronted her about it, she lied, said I was making up shit. I dropped it. 4 months later I was dropping my sons off after a weekend trip, it was about 2am, as we're driving by she's walking out of this house (ya he lived in the same complex as us), she gave us a look like she was caught and rolled her eyes. She didn't bring it up for a week. They finally talked, she said he's just a friend....well why are you walking out of his house at 2am mom, I need companionship...it just started the last week, ohh what about 4 months ago mom, that was a one time thing...ur dad actually pushed us closer, I'm an adult, none of this is ur business and you shouldn't even know about it.

Since then, she's completely avoided them basically. Locks herself in her room all day when she's home, or goes out all night. 

They can't stand to be around her and she's made no effort to reach out to them. Just blames it on me manipulating them. 

The other day her and my youngest got into a fight, he said something like are you on drugs (very high chance she's turned into a coke head). She screams at him and says no, I'll take a drug test rn. He calls me, tells me about it, asks me to buy a drug test. I bought one, she of course refused to take it.

They're just tried of her constant lies and the way she's acting. It's like she's lost her mind. At one point she was an amazing parent and wife. I still care about the girl, I want them to have a good relationship, I'm worn out seeing my kids stressed. She will not speak to me, when she does it's always rude and snotty.

Video games and concerts and movies. Fast food nearly every day. Hundreds of dollars towards tattoos and vape supplies and who knows what else. (He has openly admitted to me and others that he's done drugs before.)

Meanwhile I was wearing his clothes because none of mine fit after having our daughter. I didn't go anywhere unless I had to so that I wouldn't waste gas. I knew my depression was hitting hard, but had no money for medicine or therapy. Made too much money for assistance, but not enough to qualify for the Healthcare subsidies.

For five years, I stayed home with our daughter. I taught her colors and shapes and numbers and letters. I taught her how to read and potty trained her and made lunches and went for walks and grew a small garden. We read stories and played games and sang songs and watched little educational shows. During that five years, I barely left the house and the number of times where she wasn't with me could probably be counted on my fingers.

Meanwhile, he was barely ever around. Shifting from one job to the next, the last one being an overnight position that paid pretty well and was relatively easy going. But the increase in pay wasn't felt at all, and he was around even less than before. He'd wake up just after dinner, stick around while I read to her and we put her to bed, then he'd go to work. In the morning, he'd come home and go to bed as she was getting up, wake up as she was laying down for her nap, leave the house to hangout with his friends, come home and go back to sleep as she was getting up again, then waking up after dinner. 

Dinner was made and he'd go puck up fast food instead. His days off were spent with friends- hanging out at their work, or going to concerts, eating out, jam sessions in their basement, or playing video games. When he watched her, it was him on his computer and her watching TV. The number of times he took her out could be counted on one hand...

I knew when things changed. I wasn't certain at first, but looking back, there was a difference. The signs were all there. And I didn't care that he was seeing someone else. It was actually relief. Even now, I don't hate him for finding someone who made him feel happy again. It's the underhandedness and the lying and the sneaking that I can't stand. It was what he did (no doubt, under her influence) that hurt so much. Being treated so badly that I broke down and had a panic attack- my first one ever- because my biggest worry if I.. *ended it* was the mess it might leave afterwards...

Divorce went through, I got no help with the debts I was left, he got the car and everything else that I couldn't fit into my foster mom's small suv. I didn't fight for anything except to make sure he wouldn't get custody. His parents had (and still have) full guardianship. It took less than a year to pay off 5.5k in debts (plus the interest), get a vehicle, and a place of my own. I even have been able to go back to college, with three semesters left until I get my AAS. 

He fought once to try and overturn the guardianship. He lost. 

I thought she was safe, but now he's trying again apparently? Trying to overturn the ruling? I don't know. My brain all but shutdown on the details beyond ""he's trying to take her again."" He threatened to take her from his own parents and never let *them* see her again the first time. I can't let that happen.. I have worked so hard to be able to make a better life where I can support daughter and I. I have explicitly refused any relationships because I didn't want there to be any doubt about my ability to provide for her *without* someone else's income. But the woman he's with is as two-faced as they come. I have no doubt she loves him; I also don't doubt that she will do whatever she can to get what she wants.

"Hello all, I am here to vent a bit and ask a few questions and I'm a first time poster. 

I am just in the earliest stages where divorce is crossing my mind as a possibility. It started years ago when my spouse gradually lost interest in sex due to medical issues. We had many conversations and discussions but things never changed and eventually I did begin to see other people to fulfill those needs. My spouse has not found out yet and I feel I need to make some choices before these actions come to light. Over time after being sexually neglected and rejected I also lost sexual interest in my spouse as well. We still have sex about once a month at best. 

My question is, is there anyone who stayed with their spouse despite being platonic? I love my spouse and feel a deep friendship and respect and can't imagine being married to anyone else. It's just the sex that is lacking. I've asked for an open marriage and my spouse was not comfortable with that. If it matters we are both female. 

I'm so sad our relationship has become so low sex I feel depressed and sad and frustrated so often and I know she feels sad as well. My spouse does not want therapy and says we can talk about things ourselves, but talking has not improved our sex life. With the sex life pulling apart I also feel Les and less close to my spouse. Can therapy help me make this decision with a clear head? I want to know if we are doomed to divorce, or if some compromise can be made.",will therapy help?,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce
"I want to preface this and say I am all for body positivity and looking and feeling your best at any size. But I won‚Äôt lie and say I‚Äôm not struggling right now with my body image. 

I was really sick last year and a combination of not being able to exercise and the medication has made me gain 2 dress sizes. The doctors say this is just temporary and I will go back to my normal size in about a year now I can exercise again and am no longer on the medicine. However my wedding is in 2 months and I haven‚Äôt lost any of the weight yet. I‚Äôm also not stupid enough to try and starve myself to lose 2 dress sizes in 2 months. 

I know it doesn‚Äôt matter but in my head I always imagined looking my best at my wedding, or at least looking like my normal self. But right now I don‚Äôt look like I‚Äôve looked for the last 15 years of my adult life (I had never fluctuated so much as 2kg for the last 15 years until last year). 

We are paying thousands of dollars for photos and videos and I know in the future when I‚Äôm back to normal I will look back and see that on the most important day of my life I was looking not like myself at all. 

Thankfully I was enough of a realist to order my wedding dress in my current size, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about it not fitting. And luckily I have my health back now (I wasn‚Äôt ever so sick that my life was at risk but it‚Äôs still good to feel better). But other than those silver linings I‚Äôm feeling super down.

"Things with my STBXW were going so well as we organized moving out and next steps. She's been friendly and we laugh together. It's easy and fun. We've been talking a lot, even just talking about our days at work like we used to every day. She even spent a whole day with me helping me see apartments and we had a genuinely good time. And even though I knew in my heart that it wasn't anything more than kindness, I still let myself read into it as if things were changing.

I took a chance and asked if she wanted to hang out together not working on the house, and I invited her to see some live music and get dinner. In my head it was a date and I thought that was clear but like of course it wasn't, she doesn't see me in that way and she's just trying not to make this harder than it has to be. So when I asked to move back in, even just to try it for a few weeks before I sign some new lease, I somehow expected the answer not to be what it was always going to be. No.

This was all her decision to end things, and she was perfectly clear from the beginning that she was not in love with me anymore. She wants to explore life on her own and see other people. I really thought I had come to a place of acceptance and was even looking forward to life on my own but fuck it's just so easy to fall back into hanging on her every word hoping there's some clue that means she's going to change her mind. She won't.

I start thinking that she was giving mixed signals and maybe she was but like goddamn dude you knew better. This is not her fault, she has never once said there was a chance (other than ""maybe someday, years from now"") and yet you deluded yourself again just because she chose to be nice and helpful rather than cruel and hostile.

I deserve to be with someone who is excited to be with me and that was just never going to happen.

Tomorrow is the day my husband will deploy. We‚Äôve had far too many ups and downs with his infidelities, secrets, and lies. Last week were we‚Äôre looking at new homes and planning what comes next for us. A few days ago I checked the phone bill, pieced together the obvious connection and confronted him about once again- the possibility of an affair that may have been going on the last 3 weeks. For the curious- I have confirmed 6 affairs before this incident so I would say there‚Äôs a high probability this is another one. 

Since I brought it up he blames me for finding out. Refuses to come home. (Staying at an apartment- that‚Äôs a whole other can of worms to open). I found photos of her online at the same place he was at yesterday along with where she tagged him in an IG post about ‚Äúcorrecting her form‚Äù (he was at the shooting range) and I‚Äôm sorry there is absolutely no way that‚Äôs just a coincidence. Either way tagging him in a post about her sticking her ass out to my husband has to be following something that happened which was inappropriate. So he is angry with me. Only wants to say things to hurt me. Told me when he gets home from deployment he‚Äôs filing for a divorce because he is ‚Äúsick of this shit‚Äù (getting caught I presume.) and that today he‚Äôs cutting off my phone and getting a new plan. 

Today he has text me multiple times with an obvious intention to get me to interact so can undoubtedly pick a fight then deploy pissed at me. I haven‚Äôt answered back other than to respond to a question that requires a response about Army stuff. 

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm stuck. I know this isn‚Äôt ok. None of it has been. The more I allowed to slide the more he did. Now he has what, a girlfriend, to keep him entertained on deployment, hence why he‚Äôs getting a new phone so I can‚Äôt see that he‚Äôs talking to her or anyone else I guess.so all I can do is on is that he‚Äôs leaving the country mad at me for what he has done and I‚Äôm left in a city where I have no family or friends and no option to leave here right now (career). I feel sick in my gut for so many reasons, I‚Äôm finding it so hard to know he‚Äôs just leaving without talking this all out regardless of the outcome. I just feel like I‚Äôm walking a tightrope fearful of everything that might happen. 

Can anyone offer me words or suggestions to help me stop hurting right now? I‚Äôve already tried to hate him, that didn‚Äôt work.","Two days before deployment, he‚Äôs asked for a divorce",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"  I finally was able to close on my new house and move out of our martial home.  My wife had left me alone with our four kids (two from her previous marriage and two together) for the last six and a half months and I was excited for a fresh start.   Just the idea of having my own space that she couldn't just pop in whenever she wanted to do laundry sounded amazing.   

Per our separation agreement I signed over the martial house to her and she paid out equity.  During the month and a half between signing over the house, finding a house, and closing my wife would find ways to remind me this was HER home and that I needed to do more to find a place or that I needed to pack faster.  That house felt less and less like a home every day. 

When the day came to move my family was super supportive and my step kids even were an amazing help.   I did get emotional when I packed the last load of the day in my car and said goodbye to my stepkids.  I think I probably cried the whole way to my new home. I know I will see them again and I still want to be active in their lives still but I know that day marked a change in the relationship.  At the end of the day I was exhausted but I was so anxious to get the house set up for my two kids to have their first night there. I just worked the night away in setting up the house.   

I took the week off work. After a couple days and several thousand dollars of purchases I had a presentable home.   Picking up my kids and taking them to my home felt amazing.  They seemed to love the new house and their new rooms.  After I laid them down I felt like I succeeded.

These last couple days my wife and I probably spoke more than we did over the last two months.  At first everything was hostile.  She accused me of taking things that belonged to her (I didn't). She complained that there wasn't enough groceries in the house when I moved out even though she hasn't bought groceries in six months (I didn't take any food with me).  We finalized the custody schedule and no more then it being set did she need me to keep the kids an additional day to help her with her new job. I was happy to because it meant I got to spend more time with them.  I have really struggled with feelings of anger and resentment for being abandoned.   I do feel like getting out of that house is helping me heal from those negative emotions.  She seems to be less hostile, too, as time passes.

When it came time to have their mother pick them up, I felt a crushing emptiness.   I had spent the last several days in a fervor.  Now I go back to an empty home.   

When my kids are not with me, I feel a crushing loneliness.   The kids will be with me half of the time and then with their mother so I will be alone for a significant amount of the week.   I'm used to having them all of the time. When they're not with me I feel empty.  It will probably get better when I go back to work next week as I will have less free time.

I never really had a close circle of friends.  The one friend that has helped me through my separation  is away celebrating his honeymoon this week. I think I'm scared I don't really know how to meet people.  Eight years ago I did online dating but I was never really successful at meeting people.   I met my wife through work and she pursued me.  

Additionally, before moving out, old house definitely didnt feel like home any more but this new house doesnt feel like a home yet.  Maybe that will come with time but I remember moving into two houses with my wife and family and each house felt instantly like I belonged and that I was safe.   Here I feel like the rug is going to be pulled out from under me at any moment.

I think at this point everything is fresh.  I just hope I feel better as time passes.",A Rollercoaster of Emotions This Week,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"Currently planning out my guest list for a summer 2023 wedding.

On my dad's side he has 3 siblings, their respective families, and my grandma. We used to spend all holidays with these family members until the panini which gave my mom a great excuse to not host them anymore. Only one of those siblings is vaxxed, the rest of them are anti-vaxx and deeply conservative. 

I seriously dislike this side of the family and was thinking that if I implement a vaccine requirement, which I wanted to anyway, these family members would probably decline. Which would be great, win win! Grandma, who I do have some fondness for, has indicated that she might be swayed to get vaxxed for my wedding. Another win?!

But at the same time, we have no idea what 2023 will look like and whether a vaccine requirement would still seem reasonable at that point (it probably still would... right?). I'm wondering if I should just woman up and not invite these aunts and uncles in the first place if I'm going through such gymnastics to try and not include them.

"I am in the process of filing for divorce from my husband. He is 28 and I am 21 turning 22 soon. I married him shortly after I turned 20, and while I love him, I was not ready at the time and didn't know how to say no, given that a refusal would lead to us breaking up.

I am not a good wife in the slightest. My dad died shortly after the marriage and I was suffering severe PTSD afterward. I was emotionally unstable and verbally abusive to a man who wanted to be with me and provide for me. I had to pull out of school because of the severity of my depression, and resent him for not helping me find a therapist/psychiatrist sooner as this has completely derailed my plan to graduate. It's not his fault at the end of the day, but I can't help but wonder if there is better support elsewhere. There are some things I resent him for that I'd rather not get into. My depression, abuse, and trauma has contributed to a completely dead bedroom. To some degree it was already failing but my dad's death certainly killed it. I'm afraid to live sexually unsatisfied.

I am going through a quarter life crisis now, shocked at how short life actually is.  I am afraid to spend the rest of my life with the Grad student I started dating in High School. I met him online a month after turning 18. I feel like I've had no real dating or sexual experience and am terrified of continuing the marriage with these regrets down the line.

I love this man, and he supports me in every capacity, but the commitment of marriage is substantially different than dating. I also feel as though I never developed my own person without him, as he had major influence over my college program and the friend group I had in college. He introduced me to drugs and while he isn't an addict, I am. Nothing hard, just weed. I'm afraid for the future and afraid to be without him since I have not ever been alone in my adult life.

I am ashamed of making poor decisions. Everyone was so happy for me when I got married to him. His family has become my family. I am so enmeshed with him it is terrifying to think of him gone. I financially rely on him, and with the settlement we discussed I could easily pick myself back up without screwing him over too badly. The only problem is not being allowed to see our shared pets anymore, but he is in a better position to care for them alone than I.

" I apologize in advance for the rant...

As you may have seen from many of my other posts, my wife and I are counselling veterans. 7 therapists in 21 years.¬†

The issue is her inability to demonstrate any kind of adult intimacy with me (flirting, innuendo, any physical act beyond the odd hug or cheek peck).  For the last 5 years we haven't done anything more than that.   Before that, we did have sex, but it was still, by definition, a sexless marriage.  The sex felt very pity sex, if that makes sense. 

This was likely a result from childhood sexual trauma which we uncovered early on in our marriage. :(((( I think it's evolved from that though just as a result of two people in a strained relationship where intimacy isn't really a thing. Side note, my wife seems much more ok with this than I am which is why I'm on this sub. Hard to say though.  She doesn't like to talk about intimacy or our relationship at all. ¬†

Anyhow...

We have seen couples therapists, therapists on our own, trauma specific therapists.¬†

Interestingly, many of the couple's therapists (particularly those with a solid understanding of trauma) really take a ""slow and steady and let the partner with trauma lead"" approach. Even to the point of ensuring that the topic of intimacy is never ever brought up by the other partner (trigger).¬†

Additionally, there shall be no talk of separation/divorce either. Seems it's bad for fixing relationships.¬†

These rules certainly apply at home but even in session they are danced around, with the focus generally being much more nebulous, academic, and less concrete than I'd think would be warranted after such a long time together (e.g.  ""Do you feel yourself dissociating now?"", ""Let's learn how to do the ""rowboat together""). I know some of that mean nothing to many of you...¬†

This approach has been used by several therapists we've encountered, with very few being in the ""hard nosed, reality based"" camp...which is a bit more where I am now after all of this. And I guess I understand that to some degree. ??

But my question is this....

Has anyone ever dealt with anything even remotely close to this? Even close?¬†

I genuinely want to respect my wife first and foremost, the professionals, and my wife's traumatic past, but can't help but struggle with the fact that I'm 46. I've been in a dead bedroom for 21 years, and no amount of therapy (or at very least, this softer, longer term approach) seems to be helping us.¬†

 Is it just me? The counselling profession (even those trained in trauma)? Their lack of understanding of how trauma impacts partners as well as the survivors? How it impacts marriages?

"My wife and I got married in August of 2019 in Missouri.

"He reached out to her (on LinkedIn of all places) while we were separated and they started dating secretly. I had never had a falling out with her but I had drifted away from her on purpose because of some selfish behaviour of hers that I had seen. They never told me and of course neither were obliged to tell me but the result was that my daughter accidentally told me during my mom's birthday dinner a couple of years ago. She didn't realize that she was dropping a bomb when she casually said the name of her Dad's new girlfriend.

Honestly I think it's awful how they handled it. I would never have put my daughter in the the middle of it like that and by the way they never spoke to my daughter about it - ever. But apparently my ex asked all of his friends and they all said that he didn't need to tell me and then he asked her and she said that they didn't need to tell me. Again, I know they didn't need to tell me but I know how I would have handled it.

So here I am now. I'm the one who wanted the divorce and I'm the one who backed away from that friendship. I'm actually not upset that they are dating but it's hard on me that my daughter spends 50% of her time with my former friend. And I'm still upset with how they handled it. I really wish they had told me when I wasn't with my daughter so that I could process it privately and not in front of her. By the way, my former friend has never reached out to me and did not answer the texts I sent her. It's this kind of behaviour that made me start backing off from our friendship.

I just find it so weird. When I'm alone and my daughter is over there sometimes I just sit here thinking ""It's so weird that my daughter could be currently speaking with my former friend."" I'm not depressed about it and I've worked through the anger (except for the occassion dream where I see my former friend and I yell like crazy at her). At this point it's more like a surreal feeling when I think about it (which is not at all the time of course - but the thought will creep in from time to time of course). 

I know that at some point I'll actually see my former friend but it hasn't happened yet. I'm sure it'll be in a grocery store or something. I do see her car whenever I drop my daughter off (like I have to do late today) and it's not a great feeling but I just try to steel myself and drive away.

"Hello! 

I recently went wedding dress shopping with my mom and sister (and in once instance, I brought my dad who was very touched!). We went to several stores and I thought I'd share my impressions for future brides and anyone still deciding where to go. 

I based my choices on who had availability that weekend on short notice, since I was flying in from out of town. I went to: Sash + Bustle, Ferre Sposa, Lea-Ann Belter, Blu Ivory Bridal, and Camellia Bridal. 

**Sash + Bustle**

There have several private fitting rooms and a small showroom downstairs. They let you go through the showroom and pull a few dresses, and then they supplement your choices once they get a hang of what you're interested in. My stylist was Cassidy and she was fun and thoughtful, understood our family dynamic. She let me try on a few 'wildcard' dresses that were out of budget to help me figure out what I loved. I walked away feeling great, with no pressure to purchase.

Later when I inquired about purchasing a sample dress I tried (it was size 12, I'm a size 4) they only offered to sell it at retail price, even though I found the same dress from Sash + Bustle, as a re-sale online for a significant discount. 

**Ferre Sposa**

Avoid this place. The gowns were not very clean, clearly used, and the show room was one long room with bridal cubicles along the way. My stylist, bless her heart, was very shy and clearly new. It was obvious that she was bullied by the others in the store, and her manager was mean to her. She had no idea how to help and kept asking ""how does this dress rank to all the other dresses you tried on? Is it your favourite?"" which was not helpful. The dresses seemed cheaper, and the poor stylist kept bringing dresses that were almost identical to the one I just tried (whereas I was looking for variety and told her so). I was not allowed to go through the showroom at first, but eventually I just did and picked out a few. There was some pressure to purchase, especially since they offer lots of 'day of' perks, that aren't really that much of a good deal but appear to be so (10% bridesmaid dress, or similar). 

**Lea-Ann Belter**

The woman here knew her stuff. The shop is owned by the designer, Lea-Ann Belter, and the woman helping me, Vanessa, was a former wedding planner. She was extremely helpful. We had the entire store to ourselves. She helped us stick to budget, and showed me a variety of dresses. I got to try on a few fun ones! Before going in, I prepared a list from their website. Keep in mind that this store *only* sells Lea-Ann Belter dresses. The stylist also made it clear to me that their dresses are almost 100% customizable: you can pick the top, the lace, the fabric, the bottom. She showed me what they would look like, but I found the options a little overwhelming. If you're the kind of bride that wants to be very particular, this is your place. All their lace is sourced from France and their silk from Italy. Top notch. 

**Blu Ivory Bridal**

I got this appointment as a cancellation at the end of the day. They shop had me fill out a lengthy survey, which it was clear they did not read.The stylist was nice but a little tired. There is a small showroom with the ""cubicle"" arrangement (curtained off mirrors along one wall of the shop, one per bridal party). She pulled some dresses for me, none of which were particularly what I was asking for, but one took me by surprise. I did not find the girl to be very knowledgeable, though she was pleasant. By this time I had tried on nearly 50 dresses and done my research, so I expected a level of customer service she wasn't able to provide. For a beginner bride, this shop would be fine. It was very clean inside. 

**Camellia Bridal**

This store has a huge array of dresses on their website, which is why I chose to add it to my list last minute. However, most of the dresses on their site are not available in store - they don't have them at all. The lady helping me was friendly and warm, and she helped me into the dresses. The store was quiet (I went 10am on a Monday) and exceptionally clean. This was the only store that kept each of their dresses in a separate protective cover, so they were in excellent condition. Barring the lack of choice, the service here was very good, though the woman didn't have eye to pull interesting things for me.

"Just a friendly reminder that if you and your spouse can talk things through and figure yourselves out, one or both of you might have needs not generally acceptable in your society. Such as, one or both of you might be polyamorous or aromantic or asexual or something else that doesn't quite fit the social and cultural norms but isn't exactly incompatible with marriage. 

From my experience it is worth exploring other sides of yourself that you may not be aware of before calling it quits. Do some research, introspection and talk with a therapist learn more about yourself. 

I myself thought I needed to end my marriage but realized that I'm aromantic and my spouse figured out that she's asexual (among other things even I'm afraid to admit her). With rules and clear communication, our marriage has been able to work. It's unconventional and open and most would not like it for themselves. But, if you find yourselves unhappy with your current situation, it might be wise to explore all sides of yourself not just what society deems acceptable. Your marriage may still end if both of you can't agree, but at least you'll learn something about yourself and you'll know you literally tried everything, emphasis on literally.  

Obviously if you are already confident in what you want or need or have no inclination to dig deeper this post doesn't apply to you.","Before getting a divorce, consider how you could make an unconventional marriage work.",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce
"My STBXW and I have been married for just over 4 years now, 9.5 overall, and she filed for divorce a few weeks ago. We have one kiddo together who‚Äôs under 10 years old. I‚Äôm also in the National Guard, and scheduled for a deployment in the coming months. 

To be honest, I was never truly happy in the relationship, and I think I stuck around mostly for our kid. There was hope at times, but in the end I‚Äôm really not broken up about the marriage ending. What hurts me the most is having to tell our child that we‚Äôre getting divorced, and putting them through all of this. I‚Äôm so worried that this is going to mess my child up and that I won‚Äôt be able to help them through it, especially in the very near future since I will literally be thousands of miles away for quite some time. I know we‚Äôll be able to communicate through video chat and similar means, but my anxiety is continuing to sky rocket. My STBXW is also denying me ‚Äúextra time‚Äù with our child. She says that it wouldn‚Äôt be fair if our child had more time with me, and that our child needs to see her as well, regardless of the fact that I am leaving within the next few weeks. It is absolutely breaking me down.

Another stressor is that I‚Äôm deploying overseas very soon, and I‚Äôm going to be gone for about a year between the train up and the actual deployment. Being gone from my kiddo for that long absolutely kills me, but I know it‚Äôs part of the job sometimes. The reality of the deployment isn‚Äôt too bad. This won‚Äôt be my first time overseas, so I know the nuances and what to expect for the most part. Still, this doesn‚Äôt remove the mental and physical challenges that lie ahead.

Financially, I‚Äôm just about broke. The last few months have been expensive to say the least. I‚Äôm worried about the change in pay that‚Äôs to come when I leave my civilian job and move over to military pay, which isn‚Äôt bad, but considerably less than what I make now. I still have to get my house sold before I leave. We still have to split up assets before I leave as well, and that is proving to be a difficult reality. I‚Äôm not concerned about paying child support because I know it‚Äôs my responsibility as a father to ensure my child is financially taken care of. I know this might create some challenges, but I know I‚Äôll figure it out. Even so, I‚Äôm worried about my finances, and what effects these massive changes might have for me down the road.

I‚Äôm sure court dates regarding the divorce are going to pop up while I‚Äôm away for my train up. Is my command going to work with me so that I can settle my affairs before we leave? Who knows. Communication with my STBXW regarding the divorce and trying to come up with agreeable temporary and final orders have been painstaking. Things are taking so much time that I don‚Äôt have. 

To be honest, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been this stressed out in my life. I feel like I‚Äôm in a box with no lights, and the space is getting smaller every day. I‚Äôm tired of talking to friends and family about how I feel because I‚Äôm sure I sound like a depressing broken record. My fuse has become short. I‚Äôve been snapping at family and friends over things that normally never bother me. I have tasks piling up, but I find myself putting them off because the thought of having to face the mountain of work I have to get done is even more crippling. I am absolutely losing my sanity at this point, and I don‚Äôt know how to deal with all of this stress and anxiety.

"Can I get your thoughts on my vows? Should I change things? Just redo it?

Vows: 

There is a common statement a partner makes to their spouse later in their marriage. It happens in all kinds of relationships. Most of the guests have likely said or heard it at one point.

‚ÄúYou have changed. You‚Äôre a completely different person than the one I married.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs an accusation that things have turn for the worse, that what was known and solid can no longer be relied on. However, that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs supposed to happen.

Everyone goes through stages in life. We are supposed to change. It‚Äôs called growing. You will change and I will change from the individuals we are right this moment.

Two individuals are not meant to be the same. When a partner expects it to be, they will grow apart.

I vow to not be that partner to you. I will embrace our differences as I do now.  For that is what it truly means to grow together. It was never meant to grow the same. 

I vow to love every version of yourself that you grow into as you get older. I vow to love them as they come no matter how differently they may be to mine. Unconditionally.

I vow to honor and respect you for all that you are and will become, and taking pride in who we are, both separately and together. 

I vow to hold and keep you, comfort, protect and shelter you, for all the days of my life to come, and all of what is to come after my soul departs.

"I‚Äôm embarrassed to even be asking this. 

I‚Äôm not really sure how much to share and how much not to share, but basically I‚Äôve been asking my spouse for a divorce for 2-3 years. He is financially abusive, so I have no access to money. 

Every attempt at discussing divorce has been outright ignored by him for years. I have countless screenshots of him just ignoring my texts. He will also blatantly ignore/refuse to respond to in-person attempts to discuss it. 

Last year and two years ago he was out of town so he was forced to put some money into the joint account for groceries. Because of this I was able to live off ramen and save a little bit of money. But even with this it‚Äôs basically emergency ‚Äúbuy a plane ticket off the island‚Äù money. It‚Äôs not enough money for a lawyer. 

I called all the free resources that I am aware of that are local to me. There are 3 ‚Äúfree legal services‚Äù on the island. But I called each one. All they do is help answer questions. That‚Äôs it. Basically an hour long ‚Äúconsultation‚Äù. They do not actually help. Thanks to Covid and everything I know everyone is overwhelmed with cases (not just divorce but everything else too). 

I called 7 law offices near me. Several never even called me back. Two refused because they had too many cases. Only ONE actually tried to work with me but when we got to the discussion of money/cost she said her retaining fee is $5k. I don‚Äôt have that much, let alone money for the hourly rate afterwards. She said I‚Äôm being financially abused (I already knew) and told me to get in contact with the domestic abuse center and gave me the number. She said they had a legal team on staff specifically for abused spouses. 

I called the domestic violence center. They interviewed me and said since he is ‚ÄúONLY financially abusing‚Äù me (not accurate but whatever) that they couldn‚Äôt help me. They have a policy where they don‚Äôt help people who still live with their spouses. I said ‚Äúbut he IS financially abusing me so where am I supposed to go?‚Äù They didn‚Äôt even try to provide an answer for that. But even if they did help they don‚Äôt go into court either. They only help with the paperwork. 

God this is so long already and I‚Äôve tried to keep it short. 

So how do I get a lawyer? He has threatened to ruin my life if I try to divorce him. I also don‚Äôt have a brain for the legalese. It‚Äôs like that scene in MAID where she is sitting in court and the lawyer and judge are talking and all she hears is ‚Äúlegal legal legal legal‚Äù. That show was basically my life right now.

"Hey, 

So I've been going through the longest burn divorce/separation with my spouse, it's been like 8 months. Honestly it's been kind of hell.

Like this is such a fucking mix of emotions, things went bad about a month after a suicide attempt, which was the domino to ending my 7 years in the Army.

I tanked my savings for this person, put myself 5k in the hole on credit, because I knew we could bounce back hard if we were together. I'm holding a 30k bill on a car, and stuck paying over half a grand a month because when her car broke I flew in from Europe with 72 hours because I thought I physically needed to be there to sign off, when the dealership was just being predatory.

I touched down in the States, informing her the whole way, only to land at the airport, and have her say she would grab me that night, because she had just done some skin thing and couldn't be out for a day.

I was furious, went out 200 on the cheapest nearby hotel because I just was not mentally well enough to be alone in a public space.

I woke up when we agreed upon, and waited in the lobby like an idiot for 4 hours after checkout, she didn't text me back, only at the end letting me know she was able to sign, and I had basically showed up for no reason. I was devastated, I thought maybe this could be an impetus for us to talk. 

I begged to see her, and when it seemed pointless i told her I'd probably catch a spirit flight to see an Army buddy just to get something out of being in the States. She texted me ""Honestly that makes me feel shitty, because you told me coming here and not seeing me once would make everything feel pointless""

I thought this was a sign she wanted to see me, I caught an uber to the apartment. I texted her the whole time, asking if it was okay, she never replied. 

I got there and knocked, no reply. I started walking to get wifi because my uber had left, and that's when I saw her driving off in the car i had just bought, from the apartment I had been paying for for 5 months.

It was stupid going to see her, she told me I scared her doing that. And it was, I've done a lot of stupid things, but I'm trying to get mentally well, the meds have me fucked up, feeling like I was treated like an idiot hurts, my suicidal ideations kept flaring.

That was in September, I'm having my sister act as a mediator since until I can seek civilian therapy I'm not well enough to communicate with my spouse. 

I've become so jaded, I can't cry because of the meds. Today I thought about all of this and just got annoyed because she has like 200$ of shit I bought when we were good and had sent there for the next time we were together.

This is so fucked, like my life is majorly off track and my finances are ruined, on top of the pain of losing my spouse, and I'm so jaded I was wondering how my sister could ask for some crap back.

When does It get easier? I'm not a magically good guy, I played my part. But I didn't cheat, I never struck her, I raised my voice once over the phone and vowed never again, I told her she was ""overreacting"" once, in return I've been told she hates me, I ruined her life, I'm not capable of real love, that my closest friends are not good people, and had my accomplishments torn down.

"When I look back now, it‚Äôs easy to see that I married the wrong person. That we never had the chemistry to sustain a long term relationship. We‚Äôve been divorced for 1.5 years now after a 17 year relationship (married for 12).  But if I really dig deep, I knew he wasn‚Äôt right for me before the marriage happened. We dated for 5 years before tying the knot. I knew what I was getting into and still I went forward with it.

He ended up being a serial cheater (was cheating on me before we got married and for years afterwards until I caught him and he confessed everything). But the truth is that I didn‚Äôt ever really want him. Our sexual chemistry was never great and after the initial honeymoon phase, I honestly never wanted to have sex with him. I did have a lot of sex with him that I did not want - like a few times a week for the duration of our relationship. But, I‚Äôm guessing he knew all along and so was going outside the marriage to find the sexual connection he needed. 

He just seemed so in love with me and so willing to commit. I think after a few relationships with avoidant men before I met my exH, it was just so refreshing to have someone chasing me. I feel terrible now that I did this to him, to me, to our kids. I divorced him for the cheating but in reality the marriage was a mistake from the start and I knew it.

"Married for 3 years, no kids, joint bank account but no real assets (not even nice furniture).

Over the past year I have been constantly irritated and upset at my husband for a litany of reasons. Most of these reasons seem small, but I'm finding they are starting to build up, and now I find myself fantasizing about leaving him almost every day. It sometimes consumes my every thought, especially recently. 

1. All he wants to do is stay home and play video games or watch TV. He is well aware that I do not wish to do this constantly, and yet he makes no effort to do anything. I am the only one who makes plans for us. 

2. He leaves a mess in the kitchen, goes to work and out the door says ""I'll clean the kitchen when I get home"". 

 3. On the rare occasion we go out for drinks, he get three drinks within the span of 1 hour (this is important because he promised to stop drinking so much, and hasn't followed through). 

 4. Didn't offer to help do taxes, so I did them myself. 

 5. We haven't had sex in over 3 months, and when I bring it up that I'm unhappy, he says he understands and is working on it. In reality, he had just been ignoring it, and it took me telling him it was a deal-breaker for him to actually go to the doctor.

6. Most recently, I asked him to do laundry and he agreed. A couple hours later they hadn't been done, and I reminded him. He copped a big attitude, and ignored me for hours afterwards (then he didn't even do the rest of the laundry).

When he comes home from work, it is starting to make my skin crawl a little to kiss him. I am thinking now that I don't see him as a sexual partner anymore because he won't have sex with me. 

He has depression, and has been in therapy for a year, and on medication for two. I understand that depression plays a huge role in all of the above, but I just can't do it anymore. I don't feel that he's really committing to working on his issues (self-image and alcohol addiction primarily). But I feel so guilty. I feel like I'm giving up, and that there's this invisible army who is telling me that I'm a failure and will regret this if I follow through. And yet, all I can think about is divorcing him.

I'm 27, I have plenty of time to start over, and I feel like I'm wasting the best of my life on him.

Mind you‚Ä¶ my fianc√© flew to my hometown to ask my parents for their blessing and took them and my sister out to dinner a couple of months ago, unbeknownst to me‚Ä¶ 

Secondly, my fianc√© asked in the past what kind of proposal I‚Äôd want and I told him just something low key, I wouldn‚Äôt mind if it was just the two of us in the kitchen on a random Tuesday. I never wanted/expected my family to be there. 

Lastly, I‚Äôm 33, he‚Äôs 34, and we live together almost 1,000 miles away from my family. They already knew we were planning our wedding, we started wayyyy before we got engaged, last October. 

It was really disappointing to me that they put a damper on MY happiness because instead of doing what would make them happy, my fianc√© did what made me happy. Shouldn‚Äôt that be what is most important to them?? Of course my fianc√© heard us on the phone and was upset with their reaction as well because he put in so much effort. 

I can‚Äôt shake my disappointment with them. They couldn‚Äôt even wait 24hrs to be negative.

When we talked about divorce, one of the reasons is she wants freedom, and doesn‚Äôt want to be in our house forever. I love our house. This is one of many reasons while we are headed for divorce. I talked about the possibility of trying to buy her out of the mortgage, and basically she said that if I gave her the bulk of the mutual savings, she would be fine just giving me the house. 

I crunched the numbers, and while I would be slightly house poor at first, I honestly think I could make it work. Especially because my raises at work are scheduled. We just refinanced and got a great rate during the pandemic (we did not take out any equity when we refinanced). I‚Äôm worried I am going to need to refinance again in order to take her off of the mortgage. Does anyone know a better way?

I‚Äôm addition, I am thinking about the possibility of making a post for a roommate (since it would help, and I have 3 bedrooms with no kids). I guess I am wondering how other people did having a roommate in their house after divorce. Do people generally struggle and need time to themselves. This is already going to be a big change for me.

"Hi all, sorry if this doesn‚Äôt belong here but I am an anxious person and wanted some advice.

I have a former coworker getting married in June of this year and I received a Save the Date to the wedding sometime last year. 

Since then we have sent some snapchats back and forth but not really any full conversations. This included a picture she sent of some wedding decor saying something about how close the date was getting. I replied by asking how much more she has left to do to which she replied that she just had to finish a few signs. 

Now, I‚Äôve never been invited to a wedding outside of my family so I don‚Äôt know how far out the invitations are usually sent but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs getting pretty close. That and her not mentioning that she still had to send out invites is making me think I‚Äôm uninvited? But I also don‚Äôt think she would be sending me pictures of her wedding decorations if I was?

"I think it's time I ended my marriage. The pandemic was a living nightmare, my husband was constantly verbally abusive and I had nowhere to go. Any feelings I had for him were abused away. He was always verbally abusive but things were just so much worse as we were always around the house as I was wfh. I've tried so hard to get him to see his behavior was ruining our marriage but to no avail. We have 2 kids who are 7 and adore their dad (even though he can be very angry with them too). I don't really know where to start. He isn't from here so if we separate he will go back to his own country. I'm not sure how that's going to work. The only reason I haven't pulled the plug already is my kids, they will be devastated. But I'm not living, I'm constantly on edge waiting to be berated for something, I constantly check what I'm doing to see if it's something he'll shout at me about.

This is about my Mom's brother. He married a 10 year younger woman 15 years ago, he's 55 and she's 45.

Every Monday her car is up at this Gun Range and she tells her husband she's at work (which is on the other side of town). The gun range doesn't offer gun classes so she's clearly up there with somebody. She's always at Chase Bank on the other side of town. And she's mysteriously working a lot at her other job, like damn near every night. Not to mention spending $10k/mo on random stuff that nobody knows where it's coming from.

Nobody has been through a divorce in the family. My Uncle doesn't really know what to do and he keeps asking me for advice - I don't know what to tell him.

I'm guessing she's cheating? It sounds like it, right? Should he file for divorce or should he wait for her to do it? Should he go talk to a lawyer? Save money?

"I'll be attending a Wednesday wedding as a bridesmaid. The wedding will be on a Wednesday early afternoon, to align with their dating anniversary.

I politely expressed my concerns to my childhood friend (bride), who says it's a wedding‚Äî people can easily take time off from work, plus life's too short and not everything is about work. It's only an inconvenience to those who don't care about the couple.

As I recently started a new wfh job with the feds that required relocation to a new province (5 hour flight one-way), and still on probation‚Äî I have only accumulated 3.75 days of vacation leave, plus 3.75 days of sick leave so far. A month later after the wedding, I have an exam to fly out to, which I'd like to use my vacation days to prep and cope with jet lag, plus write in-person.

So far my partner, bride and close friends have recommended the following:

* Fly out Tuesday evening, and take 3 vacation days for Wednesday-Friday to fly back during the weekend. By the following month, I can use the remaining 2 days of vacation leave for my exam.
* Although we're not allowed to work outside the country, to ask my boss if I could work from home in a different province from Thursday-Friday? As then I can fly back during the weekend for Monday. If so, how do I even ask this? I have a fear of making requests to authoritative figures /:
* Take my vacation leave on the Wednesday, and then ""call in sick"" for Thursday so that I have time to fly out Thursday evening to work by Friday.
* Fly out Tuesday evening, take my vacation day for Wednesday, and fly back around 10PM on the Wednesday to start work by Thursday morning. This way I can use my vacation days for studying, and prepping for my exam without feeling jet-lagged.

"My partner and I are having a fairly non-traditional and low-key wedding with 100 or so guests this summer. Our ceremony is going to happen with us on a platform and our guests seated at long tables (the dinner tables) for the ceremony. We don't have a wedding party. This will be indoors, but the venue has a large outdoor patio we'll be using for dancing later on (originally considered this for the ceremony but it ended up being too complicated with moving chairs etc.).

We're going to move right from the ceremony into the buffet dinner (no cocktail hour). This will be easy logistically, since everyone is going to be seated already.

Changing jobs and locations did wonders for that, and with medication, I'm currently feeling the best I ever have.  The problem?  Spouse and I lived apart for about five months in 2021, and I loved the experience.  I cried when it was time for us to move back in together. There is nothing wrong with Spouse--he's attentive, smart, funny, and he loves me.  I know how rare that is.  The worst part, for me, is that have no answers as to the how or why I fell out of love.  I finally emerged from that awful place and found that somewhere, somehow, it had happened. It had never occurred to me that the relationship might be part of my unhappiness until I was by myself. And now I swing between attempting to argue myself back in love and accepting that it might be over.

"When our divorce came out among both families, something pretty significant occurred where both families gave us their judgment and verdict. The same people that stood there on that day as we took lifelong vows that they themselves all upheld generation to generation.

They sympathized with our concerns and compatibility issues, but they insisted they saw more love and compassion than anything else. They saw function. They saw dual incomes and stability. And they did not approve of the divorce. We looked happy, we made holidays fun, and they liked us together.

So when my EX spit in the face of both families, it felt like some darkness entered into our lives. Like all of the resentment and stress of these past generations buckling trying to make things work under WAY worse circumstances was now passed fully onto us as the incarnated demon of their disapproval. There was this intangible overwhelming energy that just screamed ""fuck you for failing under such better circumstances for such selfish reasons and letting us all down and making holidays harder"". I could see sheer disgust on the grandparents faces. I saw my parents just scowl with disapproval like ""what a weak, pathetic justification"".

While that mentality felt 100% vindicating to me due to being raised in this kind of family and already resenting the divorce, I  still had to accept the narrative is counter society. We do not judge anyone for getting a divorce, you can just say ""well he was a Patriots fan..."" and no one even asks anymore. In fact no one gives a flaming fuck.

Looking back, this realization in social context really messed me up. I feel worthless. I feel like every value I ever had is obsolete by will of society and now I should really focus on developing an insane ego that presents itself opportunistically to those only seeking to gain some kind of 'glow-up' from the transaction until they find some arbitrary reason to trade-up again. 

It feels like society is just an ego void, a place to lie your way up the ladder leaving a trail of bodies wherever you go. Or maybe the divorce was just a pill that woke me up to a reality that was always there all along and I refused to see.


Either way now I cannot unsee it this way. I see transactional online dating. I see people being tricked into working as volunteer prostitutes for Bumble/Tinder while these massive companies make millions off our time and insecurities, while the algorithms continually drive repeat use, not committed long term relationships. 


I see a society fragmenting into individual units where no one is with anyone, at least for very long. And despite conditions worsening each year with rampant inflation and insane socio-economic windfall, we continue to divide, medicate, and isolate. 


I see this bizarre reversal where in the past we can see that people had large families in part to literally survive. And there was this sense of necessity in the mix, we need numbers. So we conceded what is now called happiness (pleasure) in the hopes of a stronger claim on life itself, on survival. We made that concession and considered it a good thing. That is all gone it seems, to the extent you see the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of that mentality. You see people taking massive economic impact, complete social rejection, cutoff from family, seemingly asinine outcomes that seem to confirm the opposite mentality has taken over: I would rather literally face any circumstance except the reality of staying married (and if we broaden, in any committed relationship really).


I still believe in the hunting party and the tribe. I still believe we were meant to be together in community consisting of long term relationships that focus around living well, surviving well. And I think the partnership between two people at the core of all of this, of life itself, is not realized by shitty nuances of compatibility and a myopic view of happiness, its about compassion and kindness and loving awareness. 



But we fucked it all up so bad, now it feels like society is so sick we are all crawling off to die alone, to swipe dating apps in depressive states of oblivion until we realize its all just been reduced to dopamine addiction, that happiness was there all along just waiting for us to rest in her contentedness. 


At the end my EX wasn't even a human being. It was like if you took machine learning to /r/divorce and shit out a generic shitty EX template. Society programmed her to perfection, she mirrored the will of society flawlessly. She has the needles in her arm to prove it. The mental illness, the pills, the constant thirst to just CHASE without ceasing, chase dick, chase jobs, chase pleasures endlessly all the while dying, her personality gone. Her mind gone. Just another soulless sheep listening to the droning signal of society's siren song calling the moths to the flame.

"I'd like to get divorced. Married 8 years, together 16.  Female 40's, no kids. I wanted them but had several miscarriages. No job, used to be a teacher, but I dread going back to being around kids when mine died. 

I want to get a divorce because I hate how my husband treats me and he doesn't want to get counseling. He also refuses to go to church and says he doesn't believe in God, even though I am Christian, and constantly calls Christianity stupid. 

I try to have conversations with him and he often walks away from me or looks at his phone while I'm speaking to him or he'll look at the TV and act like I'm interrupting him. He says all my ideas are stupid and noone thinks like that. If there's a disagreement, he always starts yelling and cursing and usually tries to walk out if I try to talk about solutions. As a result, I feel like he doesn't want to resolve conflict or make me happy, he just wants walk out, so he doesn't have to change anything or make me happy. 

He yells at me alot and now I yell too. It was thel only way I could be strong and fight back. But The yelling is really what destroyed my libido and attraction, I just didn't want to be with him anymore. He knows I no longer want him touching me anymore, but he does it anyway. In fact, I am disgusted by the thought of him touching me. We live in a small house and he watches my every move. Sometimes he tries to walk in on me in the shower. We sleep in separate bedrooms and I hate when he walks in, so I started locking the door. I'm moving out of apathy and really starting to hate him deeply at the core. 

I have had different disagreements with a neighbor and a tenant and my family and he ALWAYS sides with them. I don't get along with my family and if I bring him around and they start picking on me, he'll join in and laugh and say I'm being overly sensitive or I don't know how to get along with others. 

I feel like if I were younger and had a job, I would leave. But I am already in my 40's and my family keeps pressuring me to stay and let everything go, saying he's a good guy. They never see him yelling and cursing at me though. 

When I first met him, he was nothing like this. After the second miscarriage, he changed. I haven't told my family about the pregnancies and miscarriages because they are unsupportive and their further rejection would really hurt me. It's easier to say nothing and pretend everything is normal. I have absolutely no support other than several girl friends, but I don't want to cry to them.

"Dear people in this community,

My heart is with you during your times of struggle, but being a person who has just completed her divorce, I decided to write my own take on the lessons learned and give some advice that I wished somebody gave me when this whole mess started.

**Disclaimer:**  My divorce was relatively uncomplicated -as we didn't have any kids, and no assets together. He initiated the divorce, I didn't want to get divorced. So I can only talk from this point of experience, and if you have a different situation my advice can only apply to the similar situation. And of course each situation is unique and each person's mental health is different. But here something I wish I did after separation/divorce but I haven't done which caused a lot of problems.

**Story:** I was married to my ex for 2 years, no kids, we lived in his house and also in his country, I flew into his country and was essentially an immigrant here. All of my family was in my home country. We were doing long distance before. He was diagnosed with depression and was unhappy with me in every aspect, he didn't want to spend time with me, or have sex with me. I suggested we just separate, but he applied for divorce. 

  
**Advice**

&amp;#x200B;

1. ***Get a lawyer!*** 

If you live in USA, 100% get a lawyer. And I know they are so expensive, try to ask for money from relatives or friends, but definitely get a lawyer.  Me and my ex didn't have lawyers and I trusted him, when I shouldn't.

**2. Get a lawyer!** 

I can't stress this enough. 

**3.  They are not your friend.  They will never be your friend.** 

If you have no kids, and they have initiated the divorce against your wishes, they are not your friend. Don't trust anything that will come out of their mouth. Because it is a lie. Don't follow them on social media. ABSOLUTELY NO CONTACT IF POSSIBLE! Unsubscribe, block, delete. If you don't have to maintain relationship with them (you still live together for example) absolutely block them everywhere. THIS IS A STRANGER TO YOU NOW! I know it is hard to process, but god it will safe you so much time. I was very delusional as I believed we could have stayed friends.  Maybe it works in other situations but in the situation when a person is still in love and other moved on - it definitely doesn't work.

  **4.  Don't talk about the divorce to everyone you know.**

If you can - hire a therapist and talk to them. Don't talk about divorce to everyone who would listen (ME!). I basically was telling my tragic story to everyone and basically a lot of relationships crumpled, because people didn't know how to react and would just pull out of my life. Maybe talk to you close friends, but don't do mass emails about how horrible your ex is, and how you are fab and you have moved out and move on. Don't do that! Don't talk to your joint friends, and explain why the ex is horrible even if he is (unless we are talking about physical abuse then definitely tell everyone). Stay away from social media and try to go through this phase as private as possible.

**5. Allow yourself to grieve**

Treat this as if someone died, because they did. Allow yourself to grieve and get sometime from work if you can, wallow in pity, don't shower, don't see people for a while. Get it out of your system. And unfortunately, it is not going to take a short period of time. It might be a while until you have moved on.

**6. Don't jump into another relationship.**

It is not going to help you. You will feel sadder and more horrible. Wait until you have moved on, grieved enough and are okay to be by yourself. I jumped into relationships to kinda prove to everyone that I am okay, and I have moved on and that I am happy when it wasn't a case. I wanted to win. But...

**7. Divorce is never fair, and nobody wins.**

When the relationship, the past and future is destroyed, nobody wins. The ex that decided to divorce you have not won, and you will never win the divorce. In the same of way that nobody wins in death, nobody wins in divorce. There is no prize, no ribbon at the end. NOBODY WINS.

**8. Join a gym and go consistently**

Your body needs you more than ever - join a gym and work out consistently, it will help your mental health and help you out with the time that you now have to spend alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps somehow, it will get better, you will get over them, and the only way out is through!

"STBX and I have 3 cars. Old Jeep, SUV, wagon.  She wants the wagon, I want the Jeep &amp; SUV (mostly to tow the Jeep). We agree on post divorce ownership. We live in Colorado, so 50/50 equitable division. All cars are paid off. My understanding is, the cars will need to be valued and then we split that value. In this case I would need to pay for half of the wagon, since the Jeep+SUV are valued higher. Is that a rough estimate on what might happen?  I know, you‚Äôre not my lawyer, blah blah blah.

"I'm hoping someone here might be able to give me some advice on how to get out of a predicament that I seem to be stuck in.

Has anyone in Australia (NSW in particular) had experience with a partner that took a ""my way or the highway"" mentality when it came to separation proceedings?  How did you escape the hell hole of your other half virtually controlling the entire process (and thus controlling you) by pulling various stunts designed to block things, introduce delays and generally just engage in really spiteful behaviour?

I've tried talking to my lawyer about what the STBXW is doing, but he seems reluctant to push harder and actively address the roadblocks she keeps putting in the way. Not sure if I just need to be more patient, or if I need to seriously consider a different (better) lawyer...

For a bit of context, events to date that make it really obvious she's doing everything she possibly can to force things to play out the way she wants them to -

17/01: Had ""the talk"". STBXW immediately stated intention to move 900km away, take the kid with her, and she'd do it when I was out so I'd come home to an empty house. Basically a full blown ""you can't break up with me, I'm breaking up with you!"" situation, with an added ""I know you make lots of money, I want it"" just for added flair. Lovely.

19/01: Relocation orders issued. STBXW stated a solicitor would be in touch but it will take 2 weeks. Everything is put on hold pending this solicitor that never materializes.

07/02: My lawyer sends out the financial disclosure request. I provide my documents. Also let the STBXW I've arranged for a mediator with a local provider, I'm just waiting for confirmation on the date. No response from the STBXW. Process is blocked again until the STBXW does her disclosure.

16/02: I have my first individual mediation session. Start feeling optimistic things are moving again.

19/02: Ask the STBXW when she's going to make her monthly contribution on the mortgage &amp; household costs because she hasn't made any contributions since Christmas. Get no response. I'm financially covering 100% of costs off my own income at this point. Suspect it's a ploy to make me burn all of my savings so I can't afford legal fees. Find out there's not much I can do if she stops contributing. So once again, she's controlling the situation.

24/02: Day before the financial disclosure deadline, STBXW plays innocent, asks my lawyer when it's due. Lawyer is lenient and gives her an extra week to sort her paperwork out. So the process is blocked yet again. Invitation for mediation is sent to the STBXW.

01/03: STBXW waits until the due date to respond, and declines the invitation. States she has applied for mediation with Legal Aid and it'll take 2 weeks. In her exact words to me when I tried to explain it doesn't matter which org we go through, mediators are independent - ""it's my process"". I find out that Legal Aid mediation takes precedence over independent organizations, so she's managed to block/control the process yet again.

02/03: STBXW finally provides her financial disclosure (but accounts are missing). Some files are password protected. Once again, she's blocked progress.

06/03: STBXW finally provides non-password protected documents (but some accounts are still missing). I talk to the mediator I'd arranged, mention the STBXW's reply to everything seems to be ""give me 2 weeks to find a solicitor"", and get told I have to wait 2 weeks, then get back to them if there's no signs of progress and they'll see if there's anything that can be done (issue a section 60i certificate). So yup, STBXW is blocking/controlling the process yet again.

08/03: STBXW has a big blow up, says she never wants to talk to me again, asks when can she move out. I tell her she's free to go if she wants (tbh it would be for the best. It would give me a chance to clean the unit up and get it ready to sell). Generally just bite my tongue and try not to react.

10/03: Offer to help her find somewhere to stay, tell her she can take anything that she needs from the current place to get herself setup. But we need to talk about interim parenting arrangements while we're waiting for things to be formalized. STBXW immediately does a 180 and declares she'll wait until a parenting agreement is finalized. My lawyer has told me there's a good chance she'll get primary custody (simply because she's the mother. I have... feelings about that). To my understanding this means she'd get authority over major life decisions for our daughter. Hence, she can move 900km away like she had planned and I would be powerless to stop her (for context, my employment prospects in the area she wants to relocate to are slim pickings because of the sort of work I do. I'd have little job security if I relocated). Believe this is why she's trying to block everything until she's got her story sorted with a lawyer. So once again, she's basically controlling the entire process and positioning herself to take my kid away from me (as she has stated she planned to do in the past).

15/03: After speaking to my lawyer, notify the STBXW of my intention to move out given she refused an opportunity to do so herself. However... we need to discuss what the interim parenting arrangements will be. No reply.

18/03: Again attempt to talk to her about interim parenting arrangements. STBXW refuses to discuss until she has a lawyer. At this point, it's been close to 2 months since she applied for Legal Aid, with no signs of progress and no evidence that she's even applied. The means test on their site comes back saying she's not eligible, even when I minimize her income and maximize her expenses. Notify my lawyer that she's refusing to discuss parenting arrangements and I feel like it's an incredibly dumb move to move out without any agreement in place. So once again she's blocked the process. I can't stay living with her, because she's making the atmosphere at home absolutely toxic, to the point it's causing our 3yo to have anxiety attacks at childcare... but I can't move out because there's been no discussion/agreement on interim care giving arrangements. Literally everything is 'stuck' because of these stupid, never-ending vanilla replies that Legal Aid will let her know if she got a grant ""in 2 weeks"".

19/03: Ask if she's had any update from Legal Aid, get a very curt response that she will tell me when they get back to her. Doesn't show any intent to actually call them and find out what's happening.

I wasn‚Äôt perfect, but I wasn‚Äôt a terrible wife. I was and still am very much goal oriented  but my goals caused resentment of him, while the lack of trust in him ensued. What did it for me more than anything, was that he never had my back. I fought battles alone while I pushed him to be his best self and finish school, go for that promotion, eat better, take pride in his appearance, tags care of himself, go the doctor‚Ä¶  I never got any of that energy back and it broke me.

"It's been two days since my now ex wife has officially wanted to separate. I really fought till the end to keep pushing to better ourselves, but she is tapped out. She can't continue.

Emotionally a part of me feels oddly relieved. This is hard as fuck don't get me wrong, but I have a realization that it wasn't me, I kept trying to be what she wanted.

For example, she wouldn't not move in until we were engaged, so I had two weeks to get a ring and engage. Slightly forced but I did it because I wanted to be with her. She did not want a formal wedding, I did. We went to a courthouse with only her parents and my sister present. Honeymoon was 2 days at a local area. Not at all the way I wanted but did it because she was happy.

I've always done things, stepping far out of my comfort zone to ensure I was showing I can make changes for us. It wasn't enough at the end. She admitted she was happy 70% of the time and was thinking about divorce ever before marrying. We used to argue about stuff but got much better. I really emphasized I want to eliminate the word divorce but kept popping back up. It's like this was inevitable.

I'm not perfect and have made mistakes, but who is. I admit my problems and address them directly to her. She NEVER says outright she was in the wrong or I am sorry or how do you feel about this situation. She said she'd be OK if she was celebate and we didn't have sex anymore. Just constant threats to try and get me to change.

In her last email to me, she said verbatim, ""I haven't been myself and it's not fair to me or to you to continue a marriage that brings out the worst in eachother"". I can't fix her happiness if she isn't happy with herself. That is not my job. We are supposed to be happy together, but her happiness should not solely be my responsibility. 

I'd also like to note she didn't bring out the worst in me AT ALL. I always said you make me a better person, and I meant it. It's like no matter what I say it doesn't matter her opinion is right. It hurts me because I do not believe that. I am sorry that i only brought out the worst in you... but why did you marry me then?

"Ever since the papers were served by my now ex wife, I‚Äôve been so emotionally destroyed that I‚Äôve never really had much desire to get out and make friends, and I don‚Äôt have any currently. And it‚Äôs really hard to make them at my age. I‚Äôm almost 36, and it seems like everyone my age is married and/or has kids, and therefore don‚Äôt have time for single people like myself, since those people prefer to hang out with other couples, especially those with kids. Not to mention people go on such a power trip and high horse the moment they have kids, and I‚Äôm just not interested in dealing with that garbage. At this point I just want to live like a digital nomad and constantly travel, see things, have fun, and not have to deal with any people drama. No people drama makes me a very happy person, along with traveling. I‚Äôm pretty introverted too, and most people just irritate me. Unlike the majority of people, I feel that talking about my divorce or life with other people doesn‚Äôt make me feel better and would rather just isolate. Plus being divorced is embarrassing. I don‚Äôt have the proper social skills to make friends with normal people either since I‚Äôve never had any friends my whole life, dating back to elementary school.

"People often say that you shouldn‚Äôt stay together for the kids. But in reality, how do you actually work that. My wife and I both work full time, and raising our kids (aged 4 and 8) is a two person job that requires both of our participation as much as possible.

"Here is a hypothetical divorce scenario that I am curious to get everyone's thoughts &amp; feelings on...

Suppose a woman is a successful, well-educated professional who marries an equally successful, well-educated man.  

Over time, the man becomes more and more verbally abusive in all the classic ways:  name calling, domineering/controlling, harsh criticism, yelling, judging, etc.  No physical abuse, though.  They have a couple of kids.  Wife freely chooses to give up her lucrative career and stay home to take care of them.

Let's say 10, maybe 15 years later, they reach a breaking point and the woman has an affair, leading to a divorce.

In this scenario, who do you think is MORALLY at fault/blame?  

I don't mean legally, because each state is different (no fault, adultery is ""fault"", verbal abuse is not ""abuse"" etc.).

All the books on verbal abuse say that the victim is NEVER at fault, much like a rape victim is never at fault.  They say that the verbal abuser is always 100% at fault.

But it seems to me like any woman of high education and means isn't truly a victim here.  She presumably has a good head on her shoulders and made a bunch of decisions along the way for which she is responsible, including the decision to stay and the decision to cheat.

Is it 50% / 50%?

Is it 25 % (her) / 75 % (him)?

"I'm working on assigning roles for friends for my wedding in a few months, and I'm really stressed about who to ask to give a toast. I thought of just skipping toasts altogether to avoid the issue, but one of my fiance's best friends is really excited to give one for him, so I feel like I have to pick someone for me. 

We're not doing a traditional wedding party, so I don't have a MOH to ask. I also don't have any siblings, and I don't really have one ""best"" friend. These are my possible options though:

Friends A &amp; B: I have been friends with both of them since high school, and they are still two of my closest friends. Friend A has spent the most time with my fiance of any of my friends, and I gave a toast at her wedding. However, friends A &amp; B had a huge, dramatic falling out years ago and it's still a very sensitive topic. I don't want to make either of them feel weird by picking the other one (I realize this is technically Not My Problem, but I'm still going to feel stressed out about how the other one is feeling if I ask one or the other.) They are both a little unpredictable so I don't know what kind of speech they would give, but they'd probably both do a fine job. 

Friend C: We've been friends since high school and I gave a toast at her wedding. However, I have some complicated feelings about our relationship and don't enjoy our friendship as much as I used to. She's a good public speaker, but we're very different people and I'm not sure I would love the toast she would give. 

Friend D: We've been friends since college and I also gave a toast at her wedding. She doesn't know my fiance as well though, and I'm not sure how comfortable she is with public speaking. She also has two children under 3, so asking her to write a speech might be extra stressful, since she's not exactly swimming in free time. It might hurt Friend A &amp; C's feelings if I ask Friend D to do it.

Friend E: We've been friends since our mid-20s (both in our early 30s now). Honestly she would probably do an awesome job &amp; hit all the right emotional notes in a speech! But I'm worried that the toast is ""supposed"" to be from someone you've known for longer, so it might be odd to have a more recent friend do it? Also in the past there have been some imbalances where I was more attached to Friend E than she was to me - this isn't really an issue anymore, but I worry about coming off as clingy or pathetic if I ask her to do this, given that past history. I'm also very confident she wouldn't ask me to give the toast at her wedding, so maybe that's a weird imbalance, I don't know. It also might hurt Friend A &amp; C's feelings if I ask Friend E. 

Anyway I'm probably overthinking all of this, but I genuinely don't know what to do, so I'm hoping for some outside perspectives. Maybe there's also another alternative I haven't thought of?

"So basically I am a bit torn between a couple of options, regarding the restaurant, where our wedding is going to take place. The whole plan is to get married at the city hall with our immediate family (25 people in total) and then head for a wedding lunch. I thought I was absolutely certain which restaurant to choose, but now I'm kinda on the fence.
1) Choice number one makes great sense logistic wise. It's 3 minutes from the hall and I love the interior and the food. The issue is that we can't book a private room since the only available private room is suitable for about 35-40 people and the manager made it clear that we can't be alone there since we're just 25. Okay, cool. Whatever. That said room will be available with a big table and chairs (which is great, we do want to sit together) and it would be easier for guests to move around to get to the bathroom for example. The issue is that in this room you can smoke (small European country, trying to be civilised, still got a lot to work on). We have smokers in the party but had we been alone, we wouldn't have allowed them to smoke. Now we can't stop them since there will be other guests and they will be smoking. I can live with that. The problem is, my cousin is bringing her baby, who will be around two years old at this point and I just can't imagine this little kid breathing smoke for hours. 
2) Choice number two. Big table in common area of the same restaurant. Half of the party will be sitting on a bench which would make very uncomfortable bathroom walks. You basically have to move everyone to get out. Also, you can't smoke in this area (great), but smokers will be trapped for the same reason (not great).
3) Third choice is a restaurant, away from the city Hall, which would make logistics 10000 times harder. But has a lovely private room, suitable for 25 people with chairs and smoke free.

"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm just looking into where everybody is planning to get ready the morning of their wedding. I thought I had a pretty clear answer, but I‚Äôm no longer certain. 

Our venue is about 40 minutes from our home (which is a tiny 1 bedroom apartment, so it‚Äôs definitely not an option lol). I was planning on just booking a suite at a nearby hotel for 2 nights, so I‚Äôd stay there the night before, we‚Äôd get ready the morning of the wedding there, and then my new groom and I would also have our wedding night there.

My mom seemed surprised by this, though, as our venue does offer a bride‚Äôs room and a groom‚Äôs room, and she thinks we should get ready there. However our wedding party is fairly large and I‚Äôm worried about space being a problem there, and the bathrooms aren‚Äôt connected to the rooms; we‚Äôd have to leave and go into the reception hall to use them. The other piece that worries me is that we only have the space starting at 4pm. They said we were able to use the bride and groom‚Äôs rooms early, but that they‚Äôd still be working on set up for the rest of the venue. I feel like it would be weird to be carting in all of our dresses and stuff and having hair and makeup artists working in very limited space when the venue isn‚Äôt even ready for us.

So what do you guys think? The cost of an extra night in a hotel room definitely wouldn‚Äôt break me, so that‚Äôs the direction I‚Äôm leaning.

"I am struggling. Worse than I've ever struggled before, with my mental health. Everyday I wake up with a constant thought reverberating through my head ""I have to kill myself."" Not even want, HAVE. I am here for my son, for the best son ever, for the sweetest toddler. But just until I know he'll be okay without me. Right now he has a couple of health issues that will hopefully resolve soon.

But aside from that, I really don't have much else to live for. I am so grateful for the life God gave me, but I can't handle the pain of divorce anymore. Especially since my estranged husband continues to make me feel like an absolute and utter monster. I did my best, I kept trying to work on myself and make our marriage work despite a rocky start and so many challenges with our son, the pandemic, family issues etc. 

Yet he continues to be utterly blind, selfish, and egotistical. He lies about so many things, he refuses to accept responsibility for ANYTHING. He treats me like I broke him because I asked him to leave after cheating. He believes I have no feelings and was never hurt by him. He repeatedly invalidated me and manipulated me and sold me lies upon lies. He makes everything so difficult for me. He has hurt me so deeply and shattered my trust in everyone. I loved him so much, more than anyone I'd ever loved. I was sincere and gave him my all, imperfect as it was. I already had so much trauma and trust issues from my childhood/past that I was working on. And he made it so much worse. He made me feel so insecure and ugly, in such unassuming ways. What man would touch me now, after my body has been ravaged by a pregnancy and breastfeeding and weight gain? What man would accept my son as his own? I mean even personality-wise according to my ex and my mom, I'm an awful mean person. 

Gorgeous, successful single people in my religious community are struggling to get married, so who on earth would want me? I haven't worked since I got married, and I've lost any shred of confidence or self respect I had left. 

It doesn't help that my immediate family doesn't give me space to just talk about my feelings without judging me or criticising me. Especially my mother, who doesn't forget to remind me what a burden I am by living with her. Who screams at me when I stand up for myself to put me back in my place. I hate it. I know I have things to work on, but you don't treat your own offspring like this. You don't insult them or call them crazy because they did something you don't like. It's constant stress whenever she's home.

I feel like I have no friends left. I drifted away the more difficult my life got. And the few people I opened up to are too busy nor do I want to reach out if they haven't first. Idk it's just too humiliating to be like ""Hey I wanna die, help me."" How is that going to help aside from possibily separating me from my son? It feels so exhausting to reach out to a new therapist and have to tell my whole story again.

I'm just telling myself one more day, each day. No ideations yet. Just a strong desire to not exist and end the pain and humiliation and loneliness.

I'm sorry I know I probably sound horribly self-absorbed and whiny. I just don't know what's what anymore. I don't want my life anymore.","Really, really struggling.",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce
"Looking for some community thoughts here..

My wife of 28 years announced that she wants a divorce and announced it to the kids (10/14/17).   The background is mixed responsibility (ADH on my side, resentment around lost career).  The issues have increased as I've got MH support (ADHD, therapist) and the rules have changed.

She has shown no interest in reconciliation, assessing her contribution to where we are, etc.  'I'm fine, I don't need to change, you are the one with problems'.   Lots of other issues, but that's the most accurate TL:DR

I'm generally a nice guy and would generally err on the side of equity.

However I feel that equity is unfair to the kids and to me since I'm trying very hard to get reconcile, but she is pretty much refusing to hold a mirror up to herself in the relationship and has never indicated she is willing to try.

I'm going to talk to a lawyer tomorrow to understand what the 'objective' thing to do.  But I'd value any thoughts or opinions.",Objective Fairness in divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"I‚Äôm in a bit of a unique situation. My fianc√© and I have decided to forego a traditional wedding. Instead, we‚Äôre hosting a large engagement party and are going to surprise everyone by getting married then! We‚Äôre very excited and starting to make serious plans. 

One of those plans is a photographer. We need someone for about 2 hours- mainly to capture the surprise and ceremony and then take some poses pictures after of us and family/friends. Many photographers are already booked and I‚Äôm extremely excited that one of the people I reached out to does have availability on that day/time despite being almost entirely booked for 2022.

She sent me a quote last night that I think is quite high- which is what I need your advice/opinion on. She says for two hours of work she typically charges $2000. This includes:

‚ÄúThis price includes my travel time, shooting time, editing, and sneak peeks delivered within 48 hours after the wedding. Your full gallery of 150+ high resolution images will be delivered on a customized online gallery within 3 weeks after the event and from there you are able to print, download, and share the images as many times as you'd like.‚Äù

Is this a typical price? It seems expensive to me for 2 hours of work but I like her photography style and want to have great pictures to remember the event. It‚Äôs hard for me to ask my friends because of the surprise nature of the wedding.

He has said just awful things to me which I probably can't get into, and some really horrible things about our baby as well.

"A little background: I have inattentive adhd and depression, plus a bunch of random medical issues, so I‚Äôm a hot mess, but i love life and stay positive. I got divorced a year ago and we started off with 50/50 custody, but a few month‚Äôs ago i had a couple of anxiety attacks where I couldn‚Äôt stop crying, and my ex had to come take over, and he had me sign a new parenting plan. He verbally told me it was temporary, so i was fine with it. It made him the sole parent and decision maker, and i had the kids every other weekend and Wednesdays 3 to 7. Well I found out that there‚Äôs no end date on it, so he‚Äôs basically dangling this carrot in front of me and judging my mental health based on any parenting mistakes I make. It‚Äôs stupid and asinine‚Ä¶ you can see why I wanted to leave him! I‚Äôve been getting more time with the kids whenever it‚Äôs convenient for him like if he‚Äôs out of town or when my parents came to visit, but every time I ask him for 50-50 again, he just denies me. 

I‚Äôll be honest. I LOVE my kids (9 and 4) so much, and I love them for exactly who they are, but they are a LOT to handle, especially the 4yo who is very likely autistic. This past year has been the most stressful of my entire life, and there are some days where I feel like I‚Äôm barely hanging on. My memory has gotten worse and worse. My executive function has been at an all-time low, and menial household tasks seem insurmountable sometimes. I‚Äôve been trying to get a psych evaluation for four months, and they are booked out so far. I am in counseling which has helped tremendously, and on antidepressants which also help, but some days my kids just push me over the edge and I get so angry and anxious. 

I have this mom guilt that comes from somewhere telling me ‚Äúyou need to fight for 50-50 custody or else you‚Äôre a bad mom ‚Äú but then there‚Äôs this other part of me that thinks maybe this is exactly what I need. What the kids need. My ex can be an asshole but he‚Äôs a pretty good dad. He lives in a nice neighborhood and the kids have tons of friends over there. There‚Äôs a whole community of families that I miss hanging out with, and it‚Äôs a great place for the kids to be in. 

My counselor told me if I only had the kids part time it would be somewhat of a scarlet letter on me. People would see that the dad was the primary parent and wonder what‚Äôs wrong with the mom. Something I‚Äôve learned a lot about this year though is not giving a shit about what people think of me. I have grown leaps and bounds in this area and I‚Äôm not a people pleaser I used to be. I‚Äôm thinking maybe I should come to terms with the fact that it would be best for their dad to be the primary parent after all, and to handle all the stuff that my ADHD brain has trouble organizing. It would be much less stress for me. I wouldn‚Äôt get to see the kids as often, but it would be more quality time with them.

"hello to my fellow spouses to be!  we're getting married on june 11th and i bit the bullet and did a boudoir session with our wedding photographer.

short and sweet:

i am OBSESSED with the previews i received.  once i have all the photos back (she said by end of this week), i'm going to create a photo album and gift it to my future husband on our wedding day to open while he's getting ready.  our photographer is going to photograph him as he opens it to get his genuine reaction and I. CANNOT. WAIT.  this feels like a gift to myself as well, to see how attractive i am.

cost transparency: 

when we had booked our wedding photog, we already had an engagement session with someone prior who came in way too expensive to do the wedding photos for our budget ($8,000 for 4-6 hours with no second shooter).  

I had asked our photog if she would be down to split the 2 hr complimentary session for the engagement shoot into a one hour engagement session and a one hour boudoir session, which she was very excited and happy to do!  

our wedding package was $1800, which includes 8 hours of photography on the wedding day, 1000 edited images, a second shooter, and this complimentary two hours.  she didn't have a separate studio yet so I paid $200 for a hotel room to shoot our photos in.  it was such a great deal, and we're planning on tipping her heavily on the wedding night.",boudoir shoot -- DO IT!,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning

"Ex and I share one son (12y/o) and have had an ongoing custody battle that will probably last until our son turns 18. 

Ex has claimed I'm dangerous, that I stalk her, busted into her apartment, have beaten her at exchanges, beaten her boyfriends - all sorts of nonsense that isn't true. 

Even through all of the false allegations of violence, my ex will still ask me for random things, such as;

""I forgot to get milk, can you pick some up and drop it off at my door""

""You need to come over tomorrow, I bought new furniture from iKea that you need to put together""

""Son is sick, can you pick up some medicine and drop it off?""

""There's a large spider in the living room, can you come over and kill it""

""You forgot to remind me pickup sons guitar from school, can you pick it up and bring it here""

""You need to give me $20 for gas. You could have picked up son from my place, but refused and forced me to go to the exchange""

The list goes on and on of things like that. 

Note: We've been divorced for 11 years, and I live 45 minutes away from her. She definitely intends on sending the messages to me as we have to use ""Talking Parents"" to communicate. I do not ask her for anything, and have actually explicitly said that I am not comfortable with either of us being at/near the others residence due to the allegations. 

If I don't comply, she has our son call as she proceeds to scream and shout that I don't love our son and sends a scathing message on ""Talking Parents"" that I'm not coparenting with her because I'm refusing to do these things. 

Anyone else having these problems? I don't think I'll look bad in Court for refusing to do any of these things, especially since they aren't in our MSA or Parenting Plan. It feels like she hasn't accepted that we're divorced and I'm not going to do those things. Also - these requests started happening right after I got engaged. It's almost a weekly thing now of her asking for something, me saying ""no"", then a rant of how I'm not cooperating with her - that I won't respond to.

"Alright. So. This is another 'I'm not proud of this' kind of post. I feel like there should be a shame/self-confession tag for submissions. I do believe that if you talk about things, it takes away their control and gives you power to move past them. So this is me doing that... Even if it doesn't paint me in a great light to admit it. So here goes.  
We're sharing the house for another month. There is a buyer, they had an inspector and had it appraised. They sent an offer. We sent a counter offer. All that stuff. In less than a month, we won't have to see each other as much. Then in two months or less, the divorce will be final.   


She travels for work a lot. Hasn't been around as much, thankfully. I miss sleeping in our (what will be my) bed, but I told her she could use it and have that room while living here. That was during the needing a break stage but before the filing for divorce stage. Had I waited to offer the bed until after the latter, I may have kept that space for myself.   


She's been packing a lot. I've been working on finding a job. Applied to 20 jobs in the last two days alone. Many rejections, but a couple seem really promising. And I only need one job to be able to finally lock in an apartment and start moving things. Been unemployed since November and surviving off of plasma dono's and the help of others since then. Now that I have come out of the initial 'FYI, we're getting divorced' shock, I'm able to try to get my shit together.  


We generally try not to cross paths very much for sake of civility. I saw her today, though. We had a surprisingly peaceful talk about taxes and packing. She said she wouldn't be around much for most of the next month, before I could even ask her. It was like she was blurting it out before heading out the door. Honestly, I was mildly relieved. At first, I wanted her here as much as possible, but now I feel on edge just knowing whenever she is in the house. It's weird to have that duality. Wanting her to both be here and yet, also no where near here at the same time.   


I'm not proud of it at all... But on occasion I will go into her room while she isn't here. At one point, I just went in drunk and cried on her pillow. I know. I know I shouldn't. I told her that is her space. She had even offered for me to sleep in the bed while she was gone, but I really didn't think that was a good idea. I know it is a huge invasion of privacy, and I would expect those boundaries to be respected on her end. But I think we both go against that sometimes. I know she has come into my room a couple times to leave papers for me to sign. But, to my knowledge, she doesn't come into my room for the same reason I go into her (our old) room.   


So yeah. I went into her room about an hour ago. Strike one of this tale. At first I just stood there. I'm alone in the house. Our friend who lived with us just got an apartment and has moved most of his stuff over there so that his fiance can start moving her stuff there soon. I had the light on in our room and took things in, seeing how much and how little it had changed. A small point of, ""can't wait"" in my mind was the fact that I would eventually have the king sized bed back and stop sleeping on the futon I bought online. The expensive memory foam was blatantly better than the steel bar currently running down my back every night. She had tubs and boxes sitting around from things she had packed. The pictures we had on the walls were gone. Her lone set of pillows were stacked neatly on her side under a well made blanket.  


When she said she would be gone, my assumption was that meant that she would be spending most of her time between work and her ex. I never ask where she goes. And I don't know if they have had sex yet. It really isn't for me to know, at this point. Part of me just assumes they are, though. I looked around, telling myself I was looking for things that I might have forgotten in there, knowing I had nothing left and that it was just to scratch up old memories. I missed what we had. The divorce still doesn't make sense to me. But the ex factor fills in a lot of the gaps that I don't understand. I turned on the bathroom light. There on the sink was her vibrator.   


It makes me laugh thinking back. I remember when we first started talking about sex when we were dating. She said that she never masturbated. She wasn't into that. It weirded her out and thought it was gross. The thought of having things other than someone else's body inside her didn't make sense and she didn't like the thought of touching herself. But over the years, we made it a pattern to buy new sex toys at least once per year. We went through two Hitachis, found plenty of dud toys that were cheap. Tried out some minor restraints, lubes, vibrators. Last year, I bought us two decently priced Lovense toys that could be controlled over an app from far away. One was the Max 2 and the other was the Nora. She was open to it, so we would use them on each other to spice things up. The O she got from hers was VERY impressive. Better than the hitachi. Now it seems, it was impressive enough that she has moved past the 'ew gross, I don't do that' stage of not using it by herself.   


So to add to the, ""not my finest moments..."" I could tell she had tried to wash it...but didn't completely. There was some of her... 'efforts' still dried to it. So I picked it up... and I smelled it. Just stood there with it up against my face for a good few minutes. Looking back, it could have been any number of reasons why. But the smell was intoxicating. It was a smell I hadn't experienced in months. Fuck. I felt weirdly safe and turned on at the same time. And then, knowing no one was home, I started to go to town on myself standing in the bathroom. And then I looked up and saw myself in the mirror. That weird eye contact with myself was enough to snap me out of things momentarily. I put it back the way I found it, almost shaking my head as I left the room, rolling my eyes at myself.   


I tried to get it out of my head, but that only lasted for about 10 minutes. And then I went back in. And this is where point number three on the, ""Really? REALLY?"" scale hit for me.  I looked at the vibrator and felt the rush that it had on me. I knew where I could get more of that rush. So I went into her laundry, found the most crumpled up pair of underwear I could find, and took a big whiff. Fuuuuck, it was so good. It's weird to admit, but it was something I absolutely loved to do pretty often and she knew I did. It started off as curiosity while doing laundry, then became a habit. It made me feel close to her when she wasn't around. It fired off all the sexy things in my brain at once. In the past, she said she didn't understand why I liked it, but that she really enjoyed that I enjoyed it, so she was fine with it.  


But that was then. And it doesn't change the fact that I was standing in my soon to be ex's closet, fuckin... rubbing her dirty underwear on my face like some creepy heavy phone breather.  


I again tried to put everything back the way it was, trying to hide any chance that she might find out I was in there, trying to hide the guilt I felt for even being there. I went to my room and sat at my desk. I could still smell her scent on my upper lip, so I just sat and breathed it in until it wasn't there anymore. I thought of us together. The time we had sex on a picnic bench in Yellowstone at night while cars drove by. The time we had sex on a church stage while no one was there, realizing after the fact that we likely weren't as out of sight of any security cameras as we may have thought. The tender times where we just lied together. Her head on my chest. Falling asleep with our bodies holding on to the other. In hindsight, realizing there were few times where we legitimately had a real deep connection outside of physical during sex, but when we did... fuckin... That's it, you know? That connection was God, the universe, and everything in between.  


Then I thought of her using it by herself. My brain sparked. She had this sexual side to her that had grown that I didn't know about. What that could have been like. The sound of her orgasm. Was it different when she was by herself? The fact that it happened just on the other side of the wall from me gave me a big sigh of damn. 

But then the thought of her with her ex entered my mind. And who she was likely really thinking of when she used it. 

She wasn't 'mine' anymore. Unfortunately, I honestly don't know if she ever fully was because of him. She had moved on. And I was sneaking into her room to try and steal that feeling of intimacy again. Chasing after memories, still stuck on her.   


That reminder hit me in the chest hard. We. Were. Done. Nothing will happen again between us. And on top of it, she has someone and I don't.   
I immediately wanted to reach out to a different girl that I have talked about on here before. One that felt like the Janice to my Chandler. We were bad for each other in the short time we connected since this had all started, but she thought the world of me and said EVERYTHING I wanted to hear that made me feel really good.  


But I didn't reach out to her. One set of bad decisions is enough for now. So instead, I am telling you all. Maybe even just for accountability sake. Say it out loud and it won't have as much power.   


The clock is counting down to the final date and somehow it still feels like an eternity. Fingers crossed I can get a job figured out so that I can move out and can try to maybe speed up the process a bit.

"This weekend, I was able to go with my bridesmaids to try on potential bridesmaid dresses. My dress is a long sleeved, somewhat off the shoulder, lace trumpet gown.

Following the weekend, there‚Äôs been some debate over whether or not we should even consider satin as a choice for bridesmaid dresses. Some arguments are: it looks too formal (outside venue - mountain top - but still very elegant), it‚Äôs for evening events only (wedding will be around 2-3p) and that with the afternoon sun, they will ‚Äúoutshine‚Äù me.

Considering the high cost and wanting to give flexibility to guests who would like to leave early, I wonder if it make sense for us to 

1) book a bus for a return trip, or

2) provide a one way trip, and guests can uber/lyft back (It will be around $12 per car and there would be plenty of cars near that area around midnight)

"TW: alcoholism and addiction

My (26F) dad is an alcoholic and our relationship has been rocky my entire life. For the past 2 years, things have slowly started to get better because he got (and stayed) sober. I was so cautiously optimistic and actually had hope for the first time ever because I finally felt like I was catching up on years of life missed. It was like he was a different person, the dad I always needed my entire childhood. He likes my fianc√© a lot and we have been closer because of it. 

Last night that all changed and my dad broke my trust again and I don‚Äôt think I can ever look at him the same way again after having this happen for the millionth time and after how mean he spoke to me after 2 consistent years of being sober and kind. The thought of having him walk me down the aisle or having to do a dance with him is so deeply upsetting to me right now, and that‚Äôs assuming he even still wants to come to the wedding.

I can‚Äôt imagine a way in which this gets better. I am tempted to pull the plug on the entire wedding but I don‚Äôt want to let my father‚Äôs addiction take away any more joy for me.

"Hi all!

My fiancee and I are getting married this October, and we'll be going on our honeymoon to Disney World next spring (most likely April or May of 2023). While packages aren't available yet, we wanted to get a jump start on planning, and would love advice anyone here has to offer. We both LOVE Disney, and have been a few times in our lives, but never together. We want to go all out, and make the most of our trip, while still staying within a reasonable budget (we're both recent college grads). 

We'd be going for 7-8 days, staying at a Disney resort. Looking at Value or Moderate level resorts. We want to spend a majority of our time in the parks, so the actual room/resort amenities are not as important as ease of transportation to/from the parks. We both love Epcot, so maybe we'd want to look at resorts in that area?

Which resorts would you recommend we stay at, and why? Also, do you have any other tips and tricks for honeymooners? Any dining/park experiences that are must-dos? Any foods we simply have to try?

And now she's saying that its going to stay the way it is (I have her Mondays and Wednesdays) and she has her the rest of the days.

"I (39F) have been married to (38M) for a bit over 7 years, no kids. 

I had gone and retained a lawyer at the end of March and had her put a settlement/separation agreement together. In my state you have to be separated (not sleeping in the same bed) for 6 months before you can file a petition for divorce. 

Last night I told him that I wanted a divorce. 

He said he was sorry, he should have done more, he doesn't know why he didn't try more, he blames his disease (CRPS) and he's not mad at me, we both said we were sorry. He of course pleaded that I give him a chance to go to therapy and change but said he understood if I don't want to do that.

I am sad, mostly that I let it go on that long and I thought just because he wasn't a bad guy that made him a good guy and my happiness wasn't that important as long as I could hold everything together.

I know it's not over but that was the hardest part! 

I can‚Äôt help but feel like I making a mistake but also don‚Äôt think things will change.

He is really wrapped up about the not having sex part (we‚Äôve had sex 7 times in 7 years and not once a year and when I say no sex I mean no intimacy at all that could be considered sexual) and honestly it‚Äôs a lot to do with that but also it‚Äôs not. He says he really wants to go to therapy to try to make things work but there are possibly years of therapy needed and I have a hard time saying I am just going to quit on us but I also have a hard time thinking I‚Äôll wait it out and it may not work.

I had a really rough morning this morning. I am sticking to my guns but I feel best about myself when I am in the service of others, so it's hard to put my own needs/wants first. 

I am back at our house right now, I plan on staying here so that I can work on packing things up between work. He knows we both need to find a places to live (our lease is technically up) and he took some steps this morning to get himself in with a therapist.

We are both sad, he's not being a jerk about it. He understands he put off my needs for a long time but ""wishes it didn't have to take me asking for a divorce to make him do something about it"" he blames his CRPS and I am sure it plays a major roll but he's had it since before we were married and he could have done something about his own mental health this whole time.  He chose to just let me carry everything because he didn't want to take action and feel the emotional pain. I am not blameless here. I thought I could do it all, bc I am tough and I can take care of myself and everyone else, and I don't need to worry about me, I'll be fine but I wasn't and I hadn't been but I was too proud to admit that!

As hard as it is to admit it to him or myself, I don‚Äôt think that therapy is going to change anything because the space between us to too great now. It‚Äôs the million little cuts, I‚Äôve bled out and even if I repair myself another cut will do me in! 

We‚Äôve agreed to stay out of the others way and he said if I was not comfortable with him being here, he could leave. I think as long as we can both just work on getting out of this house then that‚Äôs the best thing we can do right now. He told me to take cash he got from working yesterday because he knows I will still need to pay bills as long as we are living together (our other issue was money but mostly me feeling like I‚Äôm the mom and not the wife! I am also the bread winner but I do need him to help contribute, unfortunately he can‚Äôt be responsible with his own money so he has me take it and just give it to him when he needs it but he still can‚Äôt even manage that and it ends up with me just adding more and more to his account).

Right now he‚Äôs being very grown up about things, said he talked to his brother &amp; some friends. He said to me that while they are all sad they understand where I am coming from, and he said he‚Äôs not mad at me, but he does wish I‚Äôd let him try to fix it with therapy but understands that‚Äôs not going to happen.  

I sent him the settlement agreement and let him know that while nothing needs to be done immediately, if that we are in agreement then it needs to be signed by the both of us with a notary. Since we don‚Äôt own a house together it‚Äôs basically just saying we agree to split up our stuff, he keeps his car and pays me the monthly payment (it‚Äôs in my name solely) and we will split the remaining marital debt between us equally with him paying me payments monthly for the next 5 years until it is paid off. In my state there is a simple formula for spousal support and I would not be required to pay it to him.

Having talked to a lawyer and drawing up the agreement ahead of time was the best thing I could have done for myself, because I can‚Äôt imagine trying to get that done in the middle of all these emotions.  

I feel torn, I‚Äôve been married before, I‚Äôve been down the ‚Äúgive therapy a try‚Äù path, this relationship is very different but I still feel very done. It‚Äôs also very hard for me to consider my own needs first. Any type of pep talk would be helpful!

"When my ex doesn't call/text me for days I have felt very anxious. It's a sort of silent treatment feeling. Like I've done something wrong or he hates me again. 
This time his silence comes since last week when I asked him to give me at least $300 a month for the children. I just quit my second job and am going to be a bit strapped. I didn't request child support during the divorce because I didn't want to make things hard for him. Silly me, I know. He told me he was strapped as it is. So I asked him to pick up a couple bills like our youngest son's dance class, or our oldest son's art class, and maybe haircuts? But nope, he said he's broke. 


Then silent treatment. 


A month ago he sent me this quote which I believe was just to bait me. ""Trying to hurt me by bringing up my past is like trying to rob my old house, I don't live there anymore.""
It reminded me of all the fucking times over 13 years we would inevitably fight about his porn use, or other sexual things, me nagging him about not connecting with me... and when I'd try to talk about it or if I was still upset later on that day or a day or so later, he would tell me it's in the past. 
It is not in the past if it's still very present like a couple days ago. It drove me nuts. It trained me to ""get over"" things very quickly. 
So I took the bait and told him that people who use that way of thinking just don't want to acknowledge that their past behavior had effects on people. 


He gave me the silent treatment. Actually he tole me that I was overthinking it and to have a good day. 
 

It was just very telling for me that he is still very much like that. 
He still believes the past is the past and if you bring it up, you're holding on to the past or your being hurtful, or (the best one) you're remembering it wrong that's not what happened or that's not what he said/did/meant. 


Also recently, he told me that since he's stopped drinking 2.5 months ago, ""the sexuality stuff doesn't even come up"" for him. He was questioning his sexuality and told me he wasn't straight after 13 years of marriage in 2020. It was the end of our marriage for me. There was a lot more than just his sexuality,  but that was the end. 
Like, gee thanks for completely invalidating all the hurt over the last several years. 
I'm glad he's figuring it out. And i hope he can be better to his next partner man or woman, but it doesn't feel good on my end to hear that. It feels like a bit of sprinkling salt on a wound that still hasn't healed yet.

Ughh I hate interacting with him sometimes. It gives me the dose of reality I need sometimes though.

"Our 1 year wedding anniversary is a few weeks away, and I‚Äôm considering divorce. 

I discovered his addiction to pornography 3 months after being married. He had spent the 6 months we were living together gaslighting me and making me feel that I was asking for too much when I voiced how sad I was that we only had sex once a month. I put two and two together the day before my birthday. He finally admitted it the next day. He blamed it on me gaining weight due to a steroid based medication I was taking to literally keep myself alive. I just wasn‚Äôt attractive anymore, and living with me while I planned our wedding stressed him out. 

We‚Äôve been in marriage counseling since, and he‚Äôs been working recovery. He had a relapse he hid from me between Christmas and New Years, but eventually fessed up on New Year‚Äôs Day. Since then, he‚Äôs been trying I guess. He rescinded his original comments about his lack of attraction for me. But I can‚Äôt exactly un-hear that. I‚Äôm just so incredibly sad. Constantly.

I‚Äôm in individual counseling, and it helps to a degree. My therapist reminded me last week that it‚Äôs okay for me to be a sexual person who craves a sexual relationship. And that if my spouse isn‚Äôt able or willing to fulfill that for me, I do have the option to step away and move forward without him. Today I started thinking about that. I was in the midst of planning an anniversary trip for us, (since we didn‚Äôt get a chance to take a honeymoon) when I got a notification from the accountability app we use to monitor his activity. Explicit content detected. I can‚Äôt keep doing this. 

He swears up and down he hadn‚Äôt viewed anything. The app keeps things blurred and didn‚Äôt provide a website name, so I have no idea what to believe. But I realized that I may never feel safe in my relationship. I may never feel loved or desired or wanted. I‚Äôm 25. I want to experience what it‚Äôs like to be craved by someone. And I don‚Äôt think it will ever be him. 

I guess the point of this post is to ask if the feeling of failure ever goes away. I feel so disappointed in myself for even considering leaving, and it makes me so un-confident.

They divorced when I was 13.  We were living as a family of 4 on $65K before the divorce.  

My mom got into abusive relationships with these guys who were types of guys she would‚Äôve thought were below her before.  My dad got so much in the divorce including an extra $25K from us.  My mom ended up filing for bankruptcy twice in the years after the divorce.  She still has loans and credit cards and in retirement is absolutely drowning.  She hasn‚Äôt been able to take care of herself, her teeth are falling out and her gums are rotting - she‚Äôs only 60.  She‚Äôs miserable.  She lets this unemployed loser guy live with her, for god knows why.  

My dad has absolutely let himself go.  His house is very dirty.  He has become politically extreme and it‚Äôs such a difference from when we were together.  He still can‚Äôt figure out how to cook for himself so he lives off of ramen noodles and frozen meals.  He has high blood pressure, diabetes, and more recently heart failure.  He thinks terrible things about women and is surprised he can‚Äôt keep a girlfriend.  

Before the divorce we were much better.  There were issues later - my dad and we very distant and lived in the basement.   My mom was very mean to my dad.  I wouldn‚Äôt say the divorce was the wrong move, not at all.  But my parents are both mental children and can‚Äôt figure their shit out.

The divorce and the events that followed caused deep trauma for my sister and I, neither of us speak to our father.  I help my mom when I can, she owes me so much money I‚Äôve had to keep her farther away, which breaks my heart.

"

I (37M Larry) am going to tell my Wife (42F Mary) I want a divorce and it is the hardest thing I will have ever done. I have love for Mary as far as caring for her well being but I am no longer in love with her romantically . We have 4 kids ages 9, 11, 20 and 21. The 2 oldest are mine in every way excapt biologically. I raised and took care of them from the age of 6 and 7. So it is safe to say I am the prominent father figure in both there lives. My marriage has had good and bad times, like any other marriage. It is just hard to stay in a one-sided marriage. Mary is just to selfish and lazy. She is a terrible house keeper. I am a delivery driver and my job is pretty physical with long hours. There have been countless times I would get off a 20+ hour shift and the house was a complete pig pen. I would be compelled to do what I could to clean, but off times then not I was just to tired from work. Mary is unemployed so there is no excuse. If there was anything that would get her up and at it, it would be gambling, specifically the slots. I will elaborate more on her gambling addiction later. I am just no longer willing to make this marriage work. Not saying I am perfect but at least try to be a good husband and father. Mary on the other hand is consumed with her own wants.

Long story short, I met Mary through a friend that was dating her cousin. I was 23 she was 28. I was in the U.S. Military. Our relationship was good. But it was more physical lust than anything. Needless to say, I saw our relationship through rose tinted shades. After couple of months there was a little pressure from her about marriage. She stated that if she was not married before she was 30 that she would not get married. I have deep seeded issues that concerning abandonment. (Mother divorced and left my dad, 3 sisters, and I to be with an abusive  man when i was 6yrs old). After 4 months, we got married in February of 2009. 

That year in May, I was deployed for 12 months in Afghanistan. Deployment wasnt bad once I got into a routine. My job was night vission goggle repair, so I did not see much combat. About 6 months into the deployment, Mary started accusing me of cheating out of the blue. I had access to an internet phone service the military provided for troops to use. The vast of majority of soldiers in Afghanistan are men. I am straight so the accusation I was cheating sounded wild to me. She had a guilty conscience but I was none the wiser. I was oblivious.

Fast forward 8 months, I had been back from deployment for a couple months and we had gotten great news. Mary was pregnant. We were happy. I was home from deployment and we were expecting. Things were great! But a few months later, during an O.B.G.Y.N. appointment the Doctor told us that Mary had an S.T.D. This should have been revealing news to me seeing as I had slept with no one except my wife, but I was to dumd and stupid to see things for what they were. I never put it together, even with the evidence right in front of me. I should have realized then and there she was the one who cheated. Luckily the S.T.D. she had contracted was treatable so we both got it taken care of. obviously I had contracted the S.T.D. as well. The pregnancy went to full term and my son was born healthy. The months following, I had put it all together finally, and confronted her about it. She denied it. I kept bringing it up the weeks after that first confrontation but she kept denying so I stopped pressing the matter. I was just to weak and immature to make the grownup decision back then about divorce.

A couple years or so later we had got in an argument about some random  woman that was hitting on me through the chat on a poker game I had on my phone. Minding my own business in a poker game, and all of a sudden some lady was messaging me saying how attractive I am. I didnt tell her that I was married or tell her to stop hitting on me. I have never cheated on my wife. I cant say that I wouldnt have, cause I am just a man,  I just never put myself in that situation where cheating can happen. This instance with the messages from that woman on my poker game was just a fluke moment of weaknesses. Mary must of saw the look on my face or new something was up because she called me out on it right then and there. I just handed her the phone and didnt try to hide it at all. She slapped me after she saw the messages. There was nothing to bad in those messages. Its not like I was making plans to see this women or something. She was just saying how good I looked. Surprisingly, she wasnt too upset. I think it was because she knew what she had done. Mabey she felt empowered or something because immediately after that argument Mary confessed to cheating while I was deployed. I already knew the truth and told her to tell me how it happened. She explained that she had been out with some friends and gotten drunk and taken some guy home and slept with him. Mary told me she dosent remember much and that she blackedout.  Mary said she woke up the next morning and she was completely nude on the bed. The only way she knew she cheated is that her cousin, who was living with us at the time, asked who the guy that slept over was. She told her cousin she didnt know.

  I should have divorced right then and there after she told me the truth or mabey I should have after I finally put it all togther about the S.T.D. but I didnt even get upset at her. I actually felt sorry for her. Absolutely disgusting on my part for feeling sympathy towards her for what she had done.  There were other times that I should have left her after that. On Newyears 2012, she was drunk and kissed another guy and I didn't get mad at her then either. I justified her actions saying that It was just a kiss and she had told me right after it happened so its ok. Mary said the guy she kissed was terrified of what I would do if I found out. As I was raised religious, I am pacifist by nature so I wouldn't have done anything to him.  I just felt stupid for how my wife would disrespect me.  Mary claimed she felt sorry for him for not having a girlfriend that is why she did it. Being who I am today I would have ended it right then and there. Not to mention that on a few different occasions she had drank to much and become extremely to flirty. So many red flags and me so naive 

Mary and I found some peace in our relationship. I was able to push her prior acts of infidelity to the back of my mind but they were still there. Through the years, whenever we had a big argument, I would bring it up. I thought the hurt would be gone but sometimes when I look at her I couldn't help but be reminded. For a while I would fantasize about if I would have come home early from Afghanistan and catch her in the act. Then mabey I would haved the strength to divorce her then. I just felt pathetic and weak. I am not perfect but I deserve better. I want someone who puts forth the effort.

after I got out of the military, We moved to the northwest corner of the U.S. where I found a truck delivery position. Gambling is pretty big where I live and unfortunately Mary picked up the habbit. I do not gamble. I know that if I started I would be addicted so I stay away. My wife's gambling is not the worse habit to have but she has started lying about it. I feel if you are doing something and you are compelled to lie about it then mabey you are doing something you should stop doing. 

 I remember the first time Mary lied to me about gambling. She came home claming she had set her purse down and someone stole $300+ out of it. I believed her. I know now that was a lie and it would not be the last time. Almost all our extra money we had after we pay our utilities would go to her habit. I am talking about there were times rent money was gone. There were a few times she would lose thousands and then lie about it. Once she claimed she had her purse stolen while she was trying to load groceries in the car. She said she would have chased after the guy that stole her purse but she had our grandson in the car.  I later found the very purse she had said got stolen. How nice of the theif to bring back her purse after he relived it of its money. Another time she said she lost the about $2400 for the rent claiming it fell out of her purse. I took her for her word, everytime. For my household, $300 is a good amount of money not to mention a thousand or two. There is a lot of good one could do for ones family with $300.

We would often argue about it. Mary would say she knows she needs to stop gambling but the fact is she is addicted. Addiction is a terrible disease and it effects more than the person inflicted. Mary's gambling addiction has been a big drain on the quality of life for my family  and I.  We are no where near the quality of life I thought we should be at by now. I have been making good money at my current job. I bring home a six figure income which is conducive to a comfortable lifestyle If you ask me. The only reason I can think as to why my family and I arent better off is Mary gambling, seeing as our monthly utilities are around $5000, including gas and food.

Infidelity and gambling addiction in of itself are both terrible. Add in the lying and I am at my whits end. It has been a long difficult road for me to end up at the decision of divorce. I feel immense guilt at the thought of divorcing my wife. I feel like I am abondoning my family. I know that something like 80% of divorces are initiated by women and I understand why. Any man worth a damn cannot divorce without the feeling of guilt unless spouse did something wrong.

My wife is not someone to talk about problems, so as you can imagine, many issues we have, go unresolved. There is a huge lack of accountability on her part. She dreads responsibility. Whenever I tried to have accountability about anything in my life I find it all overwhelming because my wife and I are not on the same page. Our personalities are different as well. We don't see eye to eye on many topics. I would have to say, I would not befriend someone like my wife. I respect her and care for her I just can't stay married to her. I am afraid of what I might do or say if I stay. 
 
Mary is still in love with me, I believe, but she unwilling to understand me. I don't need her to agree with me on everthing. I would just like to have a healthy understanding of each other.  Our lack of communication has led to many avoidable and unnecessary conflicts. I don't know exactly how many times Mary has cheated on me. I don't know how much money she has lost and lied about. I can't find a way to trust her and rely on her to be responsible. We live check to check and I will continue to do so as long as Mary is my wife. 

There are a few other stories I left out that reinforce my divorce decision. If enogh readers request I will elaborate more. Any advice and insight would be greatly appreciated. Critiques are welcome as well. thanks to all who have read this post.","I have come to my whits end, I want a divorce!",Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce
"My mother and I have never had a perfect relationship, but we've been doing alright since I moved out. She is very much like me, stupidly forgiving, sentimental, and a people pleaser. She has a very sweet heart, so I understand exactly where she's coming from, but I have to (finally) lay out a boundary today.

She's been (minorly) financially supporting my ex-husband for over two years now is just... difficult, to me. He's still on her phone plan. He still goes to her house and does errands for her. He built her a catio, which took months, which finished weeks ago, to make up for her paying his phone bill. And she does this while knowing everything he did to me. She does this even though I've sobbed in her arms about all the pain this has put me through. (Obviously I am not perfect and I hurt him too, but this is *my* mother.) 

She warily has asked me if it bothers me, and in the past, I've just sheepily admitted it's probably for the best and that it would be pretty petty of me for me to want him to suffer, so why would I want him to not get help? After all, even though he left me in the worse state i'd ever been in, I still put hundreds of dollars on my credit card to buy him dishes, cups, kitchenware. I still gave him every. single. piece. of furniture, I owned to take with him when he moved out. I know exactly where my mother comes from... because I am a people pleaser to. I give too much, have so little self-respect, and end up just feeling like a massive idiot for giving to people who don't give back.

But it just fucking hurts. Because she's *not* me. Those choices, although stupid, I made out of care for the person I once shared my life with. But... he was her son for a decade. I can't help but feel like I'm being selfish, stupid, and bitter by asking her to stop helping him. I feel like I'm just ... angry, but I know that anger is just extreme hurt that has nowhere else to go but be redirected into this stupid issue I probably shouldn't even have. But I've slept on it for weeks, it's driving me up the wall, and I just need her to stop doing it, even though it makes me feel incredibly selfish, mean, and petty. I don't really know what I am doing. I can't decide if it is ""sticking up for myself"" or if its ""being petty"" ... any words of wisdom are appreciated.

I (37f) initiated divorce from STBX (39m). Married 5 years, together for 8. We have a 3 year old son. I cheated on spouse with a friend (34m) and fell hard for him. Here I am, 10 months after starting the affair and will be moving out of STBX house within the week. Lover wants nothing to do with me after taking too long to move out. I regret cheating as STBX didn't deserve it. He's not a horrible person, but was fine with mundane. While I was a s.a.h mom to our son, I didn't feel acknowledged or appreciated. He just wanted to come home from work and drink beer until falling asleep. It got old, fast. I don't regret ending the marriage. He isn't the person I thought he was and I wasn't the person I wanted to be after beginning to lose my personality to monotony. I regret cheating, but I don't regret finding the best lover and friend that I did during the affair. I want him. . While Ive been still living in STBX house (my room is about 30ft from his) , my partner has become insecure, jealous, and untrusting. He thinks AND INSISTS that I've been intimate with STBX the entirety of the last 10 months, which I have not. How do I get him back??

"The best way I can describe my partner and I is that I'm like a cat, and she's like a dog.

My best life is a relaxed one, low stress, seeking peaceful moments to appreciate the beautiful things around me.

Her best life is an active one, always working on something, never sitting still, and seeking adventure.

We've been together for 9 years and now have two young sons - 1 and 4.

Our relationship before kids was beautiful - our differences complimented each other. She taught me to enjoy adventure. I taught her to enjoy laying in the sun. But after kids came along, and soaked up every spare bit of our time and energy, we have found ourselves butting heads - each wanting to spend the precious little free time we now have on different things (cat things or dog things). Now we don't have the spare energy/time to meet our own needs, let alone having some left over to meet each other's.

I don't fault her or the kids at all - but we've grown increasingly distant (the complete disappearance of her sex drive post-kids also hasn't helped).

We talk openly and honestly about this, and are contemplating whether or not we would be happier heading in our own directions (and whether or not having possibly happier separated-parents or less-happy together-parents is better for the kids).

My first reaction has been to try to change who I am, to become more dog-like, in order to make things work and to save the relationship/family - but it always drains me, and I can never keep it up very long.

Does anyone in the other side of a separation have any advice?

Are things likely to get better as the kids get older and take up less time/energy? Is it worth changing who you are to make it work? Is that even possible? Or is it just something we should let go of?",Better off separated?,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce
"   I'm currently separated from my soon to be ex wife. I'm filing non contest divorce as soon as my tax refund hits. She admitted to me that she had cheated, I obviously didn't take the news well. Well her job gives her interactions with inmates...my first week being apart I started piecing together somethings I noticed one being she had an app on her phone where you can send inmates money prior to admitting she cheated.

   I questioned her on it and her excuse was it automatically installed on her phone when she set up a new laptop she bought. I'm not exactly the sharpest person but I knew that wasn't true. I later found out through her family member that there was more going on that unfortunately prompted me to report her. Not much more I can share due to a pending investigation and me possibly having to testify in court eventually. I'm not sleeping good waking up to panic attacks. Gonna try to see if I can get the dosage up on my meds soon.

 The whole situation is painful I loved her its hurt having to even turn her in and I can't believe I'm actually feeling guilty about even though shes the one that screwed me over. No one in my family understands that this isn't just a regular separation I'm dealing with. Its the fact my wife cheated on me probably with an inmate. I don't know what I did I gave up all my hobbies pretty much to give her attention, put myself several thousand in debt to take care of us and the animals for the 7 out of 12 months she was out of work. I feel like i was no longer useful and tossed aside. I don't think I'll ever go back to being what was normal for me once its all settled. 

 The more I sit back and reflect I also have realized to an extent that  the relationship was trying to financially and emotionally abusive. I pretty much wasn't allowed to really do anything unless she was there she always make jokes about me having a side chick but I don't think those were jokes anymore. Honestly the only Silver Lining to any of this and we never had any children.

"Me (30f) and my hb (27m) have decided on getting divorced. The reason is simple- we love each other, but we don't love each other like a couple should and we make each other unhappy. So now we're basically roommates. The divorce would've probably happened sooner if it weren't for our son, or maybe we wouldn't have fallen out of love if all our focus hadn't been on him. The decision was mutual, so there's no hard feelings and we know how we want to share custody.
So on to my question. I'm so fucking anxious about the whole living in two homes, not seeing him all the time, him not seeing both his parents everyday. He's gonna stay with me almost always, my husband's gonna have him every other weekend, but if he wants a day or two with him - that's obviously okay. So he's gonna go long periods of time without seeing his dad. He's 4 yrs old, so I don't know how much he'll understand.
  I worry so fucking much, but the environment he's living in isn't good either. Both his parents are depressed and we are snappy with each other. We need time apart, maybe we'll find our way back, maybe not. But for now, this is what's best for everyone involved, including our son. I'm just so scared for him.

"I think it is time to start seriously considering divorce, but it just feels impossible to do. My last post on this account was February 2020, where I complained about a feeling of ""contemptuous apathy"" towards my wife. Like I just wanted her to leave me alone. To do anything but spend time with her. 

But immediately thereafter the pandemic happened, my wife lost her job, and her mental health spiraled into oblivion. She has claimed to be suicidal, and I can't do anything but take those threats seriously (even if deep down I don't think they are). My description of my wife having  ""severe anxiety issues, with a side of anger issues"" turned out to be prescient. She is now diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She has been in therapy since fall 2020, and though she claims it has helped her immensely I just don't see it from my perspective. She will talk (and talk and talk and talk) about how horrible her mother was to her growing up. About how she has been affected by her mother's manipulation. I see it too; her parents are helicopter parents in the extreme, and it stresses me out too. I can't even imagine what it was like growing up. But I struggle with how she can identify the toxic things her mother did to her, without also identifying that she does those very same toxic, manipulative behaviors to me. Silent treatment, insults, derision, ultimatums I know she wont follow through on, she's done it all in the last week alone. Yet I listen to her complain about her mother, desperately waiting for her to connect the lines. 

This weekend, she reignited the ""greatest hit"" fight of our relationship, similar to the issue I posted about in February 2020. This Saturday, she told me that we never spend any quality time together. I had spent much of the day reading and playing video games. I read in a separate room from her, because I get distracted from her watching TikToks. It was a snowy day, with nothing to do, and I honestly think her depression got to her, because we've been very active lately. The last 3 or 4 weekends had been full of activities, where she had said ""I'm so happy we're out doing [xyz]"". One day I'm the greatest husband in the world and I do so much, the next day I'm selfish, uncaring, that I just want a roommate. I've come to just disbelieve any of it. 

At the end of the day, the unspoken thing in her ""quality time"" complaint was children. We have no children. Immediately after we got married (2018), I wanted to start trying. She was due to remove her IUD that same year, and I wanted to start right after. She did not. She told me that we couldn't start having children because ""you are not ready to be a father"". This hurt me. True or not (in hindsight, perhaps true), it felt like a dagger, like there was intent to harm. I would never say something like that to her, because I know it would damage her.

But now the discussion has been coming up more and more. Since she's been in therapy, I think she believes she's ready to be a parent. But I don't see progress. She is not who she once was. She has not spoken to her mother in over a year. She has not spoken to her brother in 3 years or so. Her relationship with her sister varies between ""cold acceptance"" and ""blowout fight"". She says she's afraid to make the same mistakes her mother made on her (what I want and need to hear) but she doesn't practice what she preaches. She still manipulates me. How can I trust she will be different with our future children?

I'm terrified to talk with her about this. Not only terrified that she might lash out, but terrified about what she might do to herself. Divorce is her greatest fear. I once suspected she was secretly afraid of divorce but it's obvious now. Recently, she told me of a time when we left her parent's house after a meal, she ran back in because she forgot something, and she overheard her sister and her mother talking about how poorly my wife treats me, and how I'm going to leave her. On one hand, my wife's sister is a miserable person who will probably never marry, and might just be projecting. But on the other hand, yes, this is absolutely something I'm considering, and perhaps it's obvious to outside observers (or worse, people are wondering ""why is he still with her?"")

But I feel trapped. She wants kids. She removed her IUD, and we aren't wearing contraceptive. We don't have much sex, and she is likely to have fertility issues (pre-IUD, she would have maybe 2 periods per year). I don't think we will conceive soon, but I feel like it's ""piss or get off the pot"". If I stay and we have kids, that's a terrifying prospect right now. If I stay and we have trouble conceiving, will I look like a horrible person for leaving? If I leave, am I a horrible person for dipping when she's ""on the tail end of her fertile years"" as per her OBGYN? She's 30, I'm 32. 

Finally, and most importantly, how could I possibly leave? She tells me she has been suicidal. She has no relationship with her parents right now. She has no relationship with any siblings right now. She is depressed and lonely. We have a very nice house together. We have the greatest dog on planet Earth. I have my dream job, and while she is employed, they cut her pay 20% 6 months ago and she's in denial about the fact that that pay cut is permanent. Divorce would destroy her, I know it would. She would be forced to crawl back to her toxic mother, because that's all she knows. And it would destroy me too. I cannot afford our home on my salary alone. With my debt, I can barely afford a small apartment on my own. But I can't just keep stasis. And I'm terrified of divorce, but I can't stop thinking about it.",Feeling Trapped,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce
"I filed for divorce from my ex after finding out he was having an affair with a co-worker.  I discovered the affair 3 months after giving birth to our third child.  We have been divorced for 5 years.  Numerous , more times than I can count, times within these past five years he has expressed wanting to reconcile our marriage.  Each time, things are great for a couple of months, then he changes like a light switch.  Each one of those times, I found out he went back to the other woman.  Each time I fell for his lies that he loves me and our family.  I couldn't fathom after 20 years of marriage, that he could possibly hurt me again and again and again.  But he has.  Has an awesome way of love bombing and being manipulative to get what he wants and I fell for it each time.  Our parenting agreement has visitation scheduled for him and the kids 2 days a week from 5-8pm and sleepovers every other weekend.  He has moved 1 hour away from the kids, to be a block away from the woman he had an affair with.  It causes a problem for visitation during the week.  He gets out of work at 5, drives an hour to see the kids.  He would have to drive another hour back to his house and another hour to return them home if he chose to have visitation at his house.  Because of COVID, for the past couple years, the option to take them out somewhere didn't exist.  So he comes to our house Monday, Wed, and Friday to visit from 5-8.  I allowed this so that the kids could spend time with their dad.  On those days, I cook dinner for the kids and he ends up eating dinner as well.  It is a tough pill to swallow to cook dinner for your ex spouse who has disrespected and treated you like dirt, but I do it for the kids.  Our children are 18, 13 and 5.  He lives in a studio apartment, with really no space for the kids.  The older two really have no interest in spending overnights with him anyway.  He takes the youngest one from Friday late evening (usually 9pm) until Saturday early evening (usually returns her by 6-7pm) every other weekend.  

I'm 45, with 3 kids, youngest being 5 and not a lot of time to myself.  I start to let bitterness take over at times, cause I feel like I am still paying for the stupid decisions he made.  I know it is for the best of the children, they would have no relationship with him if it was not me being  flexible with the visitation.  But I become envious that he can have a life and relationship outside of being a dad, and my life is on hold.  He walks in like he still lives there and is not a guest.  He brings his basket of laundry to do at the house as well.  I pick and choose my battles, because it is not worth the argument and is really good at making me look like the bad guy.  I keep telling myself it is temporary and try to work on healing during this time, but can't help but to feel sad and depressed.  I have pondered the thought of trying to start dating, but feel it is unfair to go down that road when I really don't have the time to invest in anyone else.  Also, the ex is still very present in my life since he is at the house visiting the kids.  I guess I'm just venting, but trying to learn to be patient.  Feels like the last of my best years are being wasted.",Trying to Navigate Co-Parenting,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce,Divorce

"So long story short, I'm a bridesmaid in my friend's wedding in October and I need to order my dress soon. My dilemma is that I will likely be a very different size six months from now for two reasons- one is that I'm having a boob reduction this summer and the other is that I've discontinued a medicine that made me gain a lot of weight and am now losing all that weight.

The website says the dress is limited edition and won't be restocked so I need to order ASAP. So my questions are mostly about tailoring.

First of all, can I just assume this dress can be tailored or are not all dresses tailor-able? Second, should I order the size I am now and just get it tailored to whatever I need closer to the wedding, or should I try to guess what size I might be? The latter seems riskier but I googled it and learned something can't be taken in more than one size. Can anyone confirm or deny?

"My divorce was final a week ago. Which means for the first time in 25 years my money is exactly that -- mine. Which means suddenly all the investment decisions are exactly that -- mine. 

For the first 15 years of our 25 year marriage, I did our finances. I paid our bills, maxed out our 401K, and did any of the investment/financing, including refinancing our house. Then health issues overwhelmed me, and I had to hand control of our expenses over to my wife, who has a much different philosophy than me. Which means the investments stopped, we cashed in our 401Ks to finance her dreams, and basically we lived for today rather than the future. At some point, I became too terrified to think about our finances and developed a ""head-in-the-sand"" approach to money. 

But now I know I'm free from her strong (!!) personality and her free spending. I know how much money is there, and for the first time in a long time I feel empowered and in control. 

This past week I've made some changes. I'm maximizing my 401K and Roth IRAs again, and I've started investing in equities. And it was super stressful at first -- I'd forgotten how to invest, and emotionally lost my will to invest -- but I'm starting to get the hang of it again, and for the first time in more than 10 years I feel like I'm being responsible again. In short, I feel like I put on my big boy pants. 

Because I'm no longer responsible for my ex, and because I got a little cash from our settlement (she kept the house), and because I am good about spending less than I make, I can see my balances climbing again. And I don't need to make a bazillion dollars to fund my life and also invest/save for my future. How happy I am for this. How proud I am for this. And I'm just so excited to check my balances every day. 

There will be sacrifices, for sure. I'm less comfortable spending on lavish vacations than my ex was, which will cut into some of my (stressfu) fun. And I spend a LOT less on my wardrobe than she did which means I'll be wearing casual wear more often and fancy-wear less often. But that's okay. Because I'll still dress well enough (I do like to have a nice shirt or two and a pair of stylish shoes), and travel a little (one reasonable trip and a few weekend trips per year instead of traveling every month),  and eat out (I like eating out at healthy eateries). And best of all I'll be saving for rainy days and investing in my future.

We‚Äôve rented a shared workspace place for two hours, and planning to cater chipotle. It‚Äôs BYOB but we need a TIPS-certified bartender there to serve. Totally makes sense.

"Hoping for some impartial opinions! My fianc√© and I are stuck on our memorial table/generations of love table. I love the ideal of a generations of love (GOL) table. It would have pictures of our parents, grandparents, and great grandparents (includes those living and those who have passed), ideally their wedding photos but just regular pictures of them together if we don‚Äôt have wedding photos for them.

I said that‚Äôs fine, just do couple photos or individual photos for them. He maintains he doesn‚Äôt like it still because my family will have wedding photos/couple pictures and his will not and he thinks his parents feelings will be hurt seeing the photos of my side, and that calling it generations of love doesn‚Äôt fit his side because of the divorce. So he wants it to be strictly a memorial table with only those who have passed. 

If we do just the memorial table, my grandmother who is still living but is physically unable to attend the wedding, wouldn‚Äôt be in the display, so I prefer the generations of love idea to also honor her, and like that it includes and honors our parents too.

"I am a 53-year-old female. Married for 34 years. Four adult children. Two grandchildren. 
Early retired last year. 
My marriage has always been a roller-coaster ride or YoYo, if you will. It tore up my children when growing up. That I don't know if I will really get over the guilt for. 
My stbx is a recovering alcoholic. He has Bipolar and I believe a few other unidentified mental instabilities. As well as a difficult case of Epilepsy. He comes from a strong family line of mental illness. Our middle son was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when he was 20 and had to be put on a regimen of medications to stable him the best possible. 
For myself,  I was sexualy abused as a 7-year-old child till age 13, when I finally got brave enough to turn my dad into the school counselor. Came awarded of the state. I got abused by foster father. I got put back in the old home with my father. I met my now stbx about 6 months later. He rescued me. 
I must mention. My stbx has ALWAYS been an amazing provider! I'm blessed and grateful! 
With LOTS of in between... Fast forward to current. My husband has always struggled with mental illness. Always put, always put a bad stigma on it. Even though it's an illness of the brain. Instead of the heart, lung, kidney, or liver. It's so frustrating. With all of this said. He's very verbal, emotionally, and psychologically abusive. He's got so much deep rooted anger, extremely low self-esteem and, controlling heart. That's its almost impossible to have a rational, respectable, calm, adult conversation. 
I've been beating him up and not taking accountability for myself.  So, because of my past. Of corse I have damage as well. I have gotten lots of counseling. At the same time I'm still broken in ways. I struggle with depression, anxiety, and PTSD disorders. I try to stay on top of them. But I do fail at times. I'm a very insecure individual. I'm very codependent. I do get edgy and irritable. I lose my cool at times and to come back and humble myself. I have a tendency to exaggerate that I have been working on. But I'm not there yet. 
I tend to let things build up, and then I explode. 
I'm very insecure. I'm too much of a people pleaser. I'm not good at budgeting. Not that I'm a big spender. That I'm not good at figuring out what to do now, for the future. I always relied on my stbx for this. I guess I will be taking a crash course now. I deal with terrible anxiety that drove my husband up the wall. I felt bad!
Anyway, I asked my husband to please get a mental health evaluation. To be properly diagnosed and medically treated. He says he will. But never follows through. I asked to stay consistent with marriage counseling and when they focused on him. He can't leave and never go back. I can't be the emotional punching bag. Constantly living on eggshells. 
Then there's the good side... he can be a very kind, understanding, and generous man! When he is, it's to the extreme. He makes you feel like a queen. Then, it crashes with one wrong word or sentence. 
As insane as it sounds. I still love the man with every stich of my being. I can't see myself without him. At the same time I'm aware of the life we would have if not much changes. I feel like a loss cause. 
Thank you for reading my very long rant.
I really hope some will chime in to offer some advice and support. I have tons of anxiety living alone. Steaming from being abandoned as a child. Not an excuse.  Just explaining why.

"I just recently had my wedding, and I did all of the planning. I did hire a Day-of-Coordinator though, and I'm so glad that I did. To thank one of my friends for her help to help me get ready the day of my wedding, I took her out to lunch. During lunch, I told her that I'd return the favor when she gets married in September of this year, and assist her with any help that she might need the day of her wedding. She then asks me to be her wedding planner and Day-of-Coordinator. I told her that I'd help her with design and decor, but that I don't feel comfortable doing the Day-of-Coordinating job because I'm not a professional, and I think she should hire someone, but that I'd be willing to assist the coordinator with anything.

"I'm going dress shopping with family for the first time this weekend and was wondering if anyone had any tips. I know there have been a few threads about this but the general advice of ""remember it's your wedding"" , while wonderful, hasn't been super helpful. 

I was wondering if folks had tips around:

- Making the most of the limited time frame
The 1hr limit seems short. I have a couple of appointments, one more formal with a stylist and another that will let me go at the racks myself. Any tips for guiding the stylist? Any tips for grabbing dresses myself?

- Making the decision
I'm worried about making the wrong decision. I am having a non-traditional wedding but my mom is very traditional. I'm worried I might get swayed to something that's not me. Anyone have this happen to you? What did you do after? What was it like during?

- Trying on dresses outside my budget
Since it's my first time trying on dresses, I'm not sure what the style should be. I also know one store I'm going just for my mom vs for me. Is it ok to give a larger budget than I have to try on more dresses? Just trying to juggle the sales person expectations vs being able to try things that might help me narrow down what I like. 

-Any general tips?

It‚Äôs clear she wants to see if there‚Äôs something between them or not. The problem is she keeps suggesting things for us to do together.

"Today was the first day I've come home to an empty house. The love of my life moved out after 17 years together. Our paperwork was filed last week and we're waiting 3 weeks for the judge to sign.

I tried to distract myself on the way home by stopping and getting a frozen pizza and some juice. I was pretty impressed by myself because that's the first time I haven't cried in the store shopping by myself. I even managed to go to the bird store that was a few doors over and get some bird food. 

I pulled up to the driveway and backed in like usual. I brought everything in in two trips. The first trip inside the house I noticed how quiet it was. It felt weird. It was quiet like it was snowing really heavy. But it was 52¬∞. 

The second trip inside I locked the door behind me. I put everything away in the fridge and freezer. Turned on the oven. I walk through the house to see what she had taken today. I don't really care what she takes but the house sure starts to feel empty. I made it upstairs and turn the TV on. I sat down and I just began to cry. I cried hard for 5 minutes straight and then made my way downstairs to put the frozen pizza in the oven. 

It hurts so bad not to have her here. She didn't exactly  treat me great or was honest with me during the relationship. But it hurts so bad not to have her sitting across from me. When I eat dinner. It hurts so bad not to be able to tell her about my day. It hurts so bad cuz she still has some stuff to pick up tomorrow and this weekend. That hurts so bad because we've been amicable the whole time and she still says she loves me.

"I am essentially looking for a month of coordinator I think.

I have some DIY decorations and still planning on getting some, but for the most part haven't thought too much about flowers. 

I got in tough with a planner via bark who sent me a pdf of a design proposal and I guess I was impressed at their effort of sending me a PDF and giving design ideas of a theme I'd been thinking of for my wedding and said I'd like to go forward to hire for planning. 

The PDF gave a quote for X amount for planning and day of coordination services, but an additional Y amount for decoration costs, including flowers per table, and then an extra Z amount (Z being more than Y) for other decoration costs I'd be responsible for.

In the PDF I took X amount seriously, and afterwards they sent me a contract where the deposit is half of X+Y with the total being more than X.

The thing is, the number of tables is probably more than what I'll have and I'm more wondering about day of logistics.

Since it was the first planner to get back to me and she'd even already started reaching out to my venue coordinator to arrange for a venue walk through to come up with a floor plan, I went with it bc her personality I was drawn to.

The contract however left me feeling very confused. 

I'm currently reviewing a contract with my caterer,  photographer, DJ, and videographer. 

My venue will require furniture to be pushed around and tables setup, and at one point then, we will go outside while the tables get put back and the space opens up to be a dance floor.

In my caterer contract I have put in responsibilities for moving furniture and taking care of garbage disposal at the end of the night.

But still someone needs to put the linens on the table, decorations on the table, nametags and favors out, flowers in the sanctuary, and decorate the dessert table with whenever I find someone to make cupcakes for me.

Then at the end of the night, I need to make sure someone's around to make it all cleaned up.

I don't know how realistic my desire of not wanting to do any work on my wedding day, especially toward the end where I might want to leave with my husband at exactly 9 pm when guests should have all left and cleanup begins, is...but that's what I'm looking for.

I think as far as vendors go, I still need to rent linens, chair cushions, and an aisle runner. So if I get those through a rental company, are they the ones that come and set it up? If I want to do a custom aisle runner than that's something I would likely need to buy and then, again, like the rest of all my DIY decorations, who will set those up?

I have all the vases for my tables and am still debating on fake flowers, but know I want real flowers in the sanctuary, so a florist is another vendor I need. Would a florist work with vases I already have? Do they actually setup the flowers? If I wanted bouquets from them as well, how do those get to us?

The cupcakes will probably get delivered by a bakery yes? But who do I put in charge of getting the cupcakes onto a stand and then setting out the rest of my DIY decorations for the table?

Then at the end of the night, with the caterer responsible for garbage and putting furniture back, what else do I need to account for? Is there a world in which I could leave at 9 pm and not think about anything and trust that it'll have all gotten cleaned up okay?

So, in other words, I feel like I've already done a lot of the heavy lifting but for all this to go smoothly I think I need to meet with someone actually at the venue beforehand who will know where to direct the caterers to move which furniture and exactly how to setup the tables and then...the rest of the decoration setup which seems Iike a lot for 1 person so this is where I get lost on what I need to hire ...

Which is where the contract in question is what I'd like advice on. The contract doesn't have much details about day of coordination but does state they're responsible for setting up the event and decorations beforehand and then ""coordinating cleanup"". Which, I see the word coordinating and think, sure, they coordinate with caterer to cleanup, but also, like, are there other things??

So then I'd be fine paying a deposit on the planning (or how is planning and coordination costs usually paid for? All at once?) but the deposit being the full X amount for planning plus some of Y which puts things like $200/table in costs....that's where I'm like wat?

It seems like it's a weird mix of coordination and florist in 1 contract and I don't want to put a deposit on something I haven't decided yet or actually know what the flowers will be, etc.

"Due to budget and logistical reasons we could only offer plus ones to guests that were married, engaged, living together/had been dating for awhile. We are paying for a number of meals and activities so pretty much all the guests understood us having to do this. In order to cut down on guests bringing uninvited plus ones, we addressed the wedding invites by name to the plus ones we thought people would bring and only enabled them to RSVP for that person on our wedding website.

We had one couple friend ‚ÄúSally‚Äù and ‚ÄúJack‚Äù who were the first to rsvp. Though they live across the country so we don‚Äôt get to see them much, ‚ÄúSally‚Äù was one of my partner‚Äôs oldest friends and Jack was a nice guy, so we‚Äôd often go on couple‚Äôs trips together and just really gelled well. 

Unfortunately a few months ago Sally let us know that she and Jack were getting divorced as I guess things hadn‚Äôt been working for awhile, and that she was already dating another guy.

Sally is going full hog with this dude and really rushing into the new relationship head on full rebound style. She‚Äôs known him for years as I guess they used to hook up a long time ago, but has only been actually dating him a few months and is making many crazy decisions regarding this new dude. We felt bad for Jack, but Sally is my partner‚Äôs friend, so we tried not to judge and just generally wished them both well. Sally let us know that she wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it to the wedding after all, and we totally understood as she‚Äôs in the middle of a divorce and a lot of her circumstances had changed.

Queue to now, we get an RSVP update notification from our wedding website that Sally has changed her mind and is coming after all. Obviously we‚Äôre happy and looking forward to seeing her. Then we see that she has also rsvp‚Äôd yes for Jack - for a brief moment we were confused what was going on, and then realized, SHE USED JACK‚ÄôS INVITE TO RSVP FOR NEW DUDE!

We were so surprised that she had the ovaries to do this without asking or checking that we couldn‚Äôt even say no and just sucked it up. So word of caution ya‚Äôll, if some guests have the audacity to invite their own plus one, sometimes no plan is foolproof!","For those of you struggling with guests wanting to bring uninvited plus ones, some folks are indeed BOLD!",weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning,weddingplanning
"Hi! I recently got engaged in November and we planned for a November 2023 wedding. I've budgeted what I could out and see a little wiggle room, and couldn't picture my big day without at least a highlight reel of the wedding. I've interviewed a few and they are just too expensive, even with a-la-carte options. I spoke with the sweetest girl yesterday; her full day package is $600, and while that's a good deal - I do know you get what you pay for. However I'm willing to give it a shot considering she has more than a year and a half to get more experience under her belt.

"I've really got myself in a pickle with hair and makeup for the morning of my wedding and I could do with some advice but mostly an opportunity to vent. 

When we first started planning, I decided that I wanted to get ready at home with my MOH and my partner (he'd be there but doing his own thing not necessarily hanging out with us the whole time). My MOH said she was happy to do her own hair and makeup which was perfect as obviously it saves time. We want to do photos before the ceremony so I need to be ready for 10.30 and therefore thought hair and makeup 8-10 would be perfect


About a month ago my MIL mentioned she wanted to get her hair done but was struggling to find someone to come to her hotel just for her hair only. I offered to ask my HMUA if she could do it. I then felt obligated to ask my Mum and my sister. On top of that, I also was worried that we might be essentially homeless at the time of our wedding as we are selling our flat and we're trying to buy a house but hadn't found it yet. I then decided to book an airbnb for my mum, sister and MOH to stay in next to the venue so we could all get ready in the same place even if we didn't have our own home at that time. I then offered again hair and makeup to my MOH and she said yes if everyone else was getting it.

I had my trial a couple of weeks ago and loved it. I asked my HMUA if we could add some more people for hair and makeup and I put this in writing last week asking for 2 extras for hair and 2 for hair and makeup. She came back with the schedule and obviously it is starting REALLY early even with her bringing a helper and actually the schedule she gave finished at 11am not 10.30am. The whole thing is really stressing me out as it is so far from the relaxed morning that I wanted

On top of all this are complicated family relationships and I don't actually think I want to be with my mum or sister in the morning. My sister struggles with her mental health and a wedding (especially my wedding) is the exact type of thing that is going to stress her out and often she lashes out in these situations. My mum has so far made it clear she has no interest in weddings even it its her own daughter getting married and she is just generally not someone I like to have around me when I'm stressed.

Given ALL of this. I'd really like to go back to my original plan of just me getting hair and makeup done in the morning and ask my HMUA if she can go to my MILs hotel (happy to pay extra). I'm worried she will be annoyed about me saying I wanted more people then backing out.

"Hi Weddit,

This makes me feel awkward and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being overly sensitive or not. What‚Äôs your opinion?

I just found out a guest who‚Äôs the plus one of a friend (we‚Äôre friends, but she‚Äôs mainly the partner of my old college friend) told me she‚Äôs ordering a dress made by the dressmaker who made my wedding dress. She asked me which colors would be okay. 

So‚Ä¶ obviously I was like please don‚Äôt wear the white one (cause she did have white ones picked out) but I didn‚Äôt really know how to respond cause she‚Äôs honestly gonna blow me out of the water wearing anything made by this dressmaker. She‚Äôs like a glorious smoldering busty tall dark goddess who recently lost a bunch of weight and wants to show off her new body, which I‚Äôm like cool! Go you! But also‚Ä¶ I kinda don‚Äôt really wanna be upstaged by her and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs irrational to think she will do that. 


So, she‚Äôs not gonna wear a white dress, but she is an absolute bombshell and she‚Äôs gonna spend literally thousands on a bespoke gown from the same dressmaker as my wedding dress. Uh. Am I valid in feeling a bit gross about that or am I totally in the wrong and just being overly insecure?

"I 24f want to leave my 24m spouse. I have no clue what to do. Well I know what I want to do, but the unknown seems scary. 

There isn‚Äôt a huge fall out that happened between us besides that fact we just simply do not get along/communicate well.

Also, we have 2 children together who are 2 years old and 8 months old. He is so against divorce and anytime I mention it or bring it up he starts calling me names, tells me I‚Äôm crazy, no one will want me or a single mom, and starts mentioning harming himself. He makes me feel so stuck. 

He also threatens to make my life hell if I leave him, and has just become so toxic to me. Like I said previously, I just don‚Äôt even know who he is anymore. He is no longer my best friend, or the person I agreed to marry. 

I started taking depression medications assuming I had post partum Depression and anxiety but I have come to realize it all stems from being around him. 

When it is just my kids and I, I am not stressed, angry, or anxious. But the moment he‚Äôs home I feel like I‚Äôm always tense and on guard waiting to snap.
